## Introduction

The **Marketplace Curation** feature is a governance capability within the Mendix Platform. With this feature, you can translate the company's policies and guidelines for public Marketplace content to curation settings. Marketplace components that meet these requirements will get a company approved label: <text class="badge badge-pill badge-company-approved" style="margin-left:0px"> {{% icon name="checkmark-shield-filled" color="green" %}}COMPANY APPROVED</text>. This way, developers from your company can easily see which public content is company approved according to your company policies and guidelines. This functionality provides several key benefits:

* Developer guidance – Developers can easily identify Marketplace content suitable for their apps by filtering Marketplace content by the company approved label in Studio Pro's Marketplace section or on the Marketplace website. This helps developers find valuable and relevant content for app development in your company.     
  For more information, see [Displaying Company Approved Marketplace Content in Studio Pro](#display-company-approved-marketplace-content).
* Enhanced marketplace exploration – By specifying criteria for company approved content, developers can explore a wider array of public content, enabling them to leverage resources for their apps.
* Governance control – Centralized curation allows Mendix Admins to translate offline policies and guidelines to an in-platform experience, establishing efficient communication and time-saving processes between developers and Mendix Admins.

The **Marketplace Curation** page contains two tabs: [Curation Settings](#curation-settings) and [Marketplace Content List](#marketplace-content-list).

## Curation Settings {#curation-settings}

On the **Curation Settings** tab, you can configure company policies and guidelines for public Marketplace content.  

Select the support types and license types. Public Marketplace components that meet your requirements will be automatically labeled as company approved. For instance, in the following example, any component supported by the **Community** or **Platform** and licensed under **Apache v2** or **BSD 2.0** will be labeled as company approved.

## Marketplace Content List {#marketplace-content-list}

The **Marketplace Content List** tab lists all public Marketplace content. It includes information about whether a component carries the company approved label, and if so, it shows the source of the label. These are the details displayed in the list:

* **Content Name** – This shows the name of the content.
* **Support** – This shows the support type of the content.
* **Updated on** – This shows the date when the content was most recently updated.
* **License** – This shows the license of the content.
* **Label** – This shows whether the content has a company approved label.
* **Source** – This indicates the origin of the label:

    * **Curation Setting** – The company approved label is added automatically based on the curation settings.
    * **Manual** – The company approved label is added manually by a Mendix Admin.

You can manually add or remove a label after selecting the content from the list. For content that is not company approved based on your curation settings, you can manually add the label by clicking the **Add Label** button. Conversely, for content that is company approved based on the curation settings, you can manually remove the label by clicking the **Remove Label** button.

{{% alert color="info" %}}If you manually add a company approved label to a Marketplace component, this Marketplace component will always keep the label, even if the curation settings get changed later. However, if you manually remove a company approved label from a Marketplace component, then the label will automatically appear again if the curation settings get changed later and the Marketplace component meets the new requirements. {{% /alert %}}

## Displaying Company Approved Marketplace Content in Studio Pro {#display-company-approved-marketplace-content}

In Studio Pro's Marketplace section, developers can view all Marketplace components, company approved content or not. To only see company approved content, select the **Show <text class="badge badge-pill badge-company-approved" style="margin-left:0px"> {{% icon name="checkmark-shield-filled" color="green" %}}COMPANY APPROVED</text>** check box.    

The company approved label is also visible on the details page in the main panel.
