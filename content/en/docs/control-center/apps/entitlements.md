## Introduction

The **Entitlements** section is a self-service tool that provides access to transactions which use Mendix Cloud Tokens, and that helps manage plan change requests. It also displays the number of entitled, consumed, and remaining Mendix Cloud Tokens.

This section contains the following pages:

* [Cloud Tokens](#cloud-tokens-page) <!--* End-users -->
* [Requests](#plan-change-requests-tab)

## The Cloud Tokens Page {#cloud-tokens-page}

The **Cloud Tokens** page displays the total number of Mendix Cloud Tokens that your company is entitled to, as well as the number of consumed and available Mendix Cloud Tokens.

It also includes a list of transactions that use Mendix Cloud Tokens. These are the details available for each transaction:

* **Transaction** – The identifier of the transaction, made up of the provisioned plan, and the impacted application and environment.
* **Transaction Date** - The date when the transaction occurred.
* **Quantity** - The number of Mendix Cloud Tokens credited or debited. <!-- check -->
* **Tokens per Unit** – The number of Mendix Cloud Tokens included in the transaction. <!-- check -->
* **Transaction Type** – This can be either **Credit** or **Debit**.
* **Cloud Tokens** – The number of Mendix Cloud Tokens consumed within the transaction. <!-- check -->

### Mendix Cloud Tokens {#cloud-tokens}

Mendix Cloud Tokens are a type of Token that can be used within the Mendix Platform to consume Cloud Resources, such as  [Cloud Resource Packs](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#resource-pack) (CRPs), for your Mendix Cloud deployments. The contractual definitions of Tokens and Mendix Cloud Tokens can be found on our [Order Form Definitions](https://www.mendix.com/legal/platform-usage/order-form-definitions/#section-9) page.

### Cloud Resource Packs {#crps}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
For the technical details of each cloud resource pack, see the [Cloud Resource Packs](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#resource-pack) section of *Mendix Cloud*.
{{% /alert %}}

The number of Mendix Cloud Tokens required for each type of Cloud Resource Pack is specified in the [Cloud Resource Packs](#crps) section of this document. All your current CRPs will be converted to their equivalent Mendix Cloud Tokens and aggregated with any other Mendix Cloud Tokens. You can then use these to provision Cloud resources (of any type and size) as specified in your contracts. 

You can see available and used Mendix Cloud Tokens on the **Entitlements** page. If you cannot, contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM).

These tables show how many Mendix Cloud Tokens each CRP requires:

#### Legacy Cloud Resource Packs

You can no longer purchase Legacy Cloud Resources Packs. You can now only purchase and provision Standard, Premium, and Premium Plus CRPs. Any legacy Cloud Resource Packs that you have already purchased will be converted into Mendix Cloud Tokens if they are deprovisioned. This will use the rate specified in the [Cloud Resource Packs](#crps) section, and the Mendix Cloud Tokens will be added to your Token pool.

### Key Takeaways

* Mendix Cloud Tokens are a specific type of Token used to access Cloud Resources in the Mendix Platform.
* The number of Mendix Cloud Tokens required depends on the CRP you want.
* You buy Tokens in advance, and can use them to obtain CRPs.
* If you no longer need those resources, you can reuse the Token to obtain other CRPs, or keep it to be used later.
