## Introduction

The **Apps** page in Control Center provides a central place to monitor, manage, and interact with all the apps belonging to your company. 

Using the search bar at the top of the page, you can find an app using either its name or app ID (which you can find under **Project ID** in your app’s [Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/) in [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/)).

{{< figure src="/attachments/control-center/apps/apps-overview/top-search-bar.png" >}}

Search results appear in a pop-up window where you can apply filters for **AppName**, **AppID**, **Technical Contact**, **Last Commit**, **Created Date**, and **Deployment**. Click the app name to open the [app details](#app-details).

The **Apps** page includes the following tabs: **Mendix Cloud**, **Private Cloud**, **Mendix Free Cloud**, **Other Apps**, and **Deactivated Apps**.

Each tab contains a table. By clicking the column selector ({{% icon name="view" %}}) in the upper-right corner of the table, you can choose which fields to display. You can also:

* Filter the apps in the table. For details, see the [Filtering Apps in the Table](#filter-apps) section
* Export app information to an Excel file. For details, see the [Exporting Apps to an Excel File](#export-to-excel) section

## Mendix Cloud

The **Mendix Cloud** tab lists all licensed apps that can be deployed on Mendix Cloud.

By default, the table shows only apps published in the production environments. To view all environments, toggle off the **Production** switch in the upper-right corner of the table.

When you select apps using the checkboxes in the table, a context menu appears at the bottom of the screen. Use it to export the selected apps.

See the [Fields Glossary](#fields-glossary) section for descriptions of the table columns.

## Mendix on Kubernetes (Connected) {#pc-connected}

The **Mendix on Kubernetes** tab shows all the apps that are deployed on the Mendix on Kubernetes Connected.

See the [Fields Glossary](#fields-glossary) section for descriptions of the table columns.

## Mendix Free Cloud

The **Mendix Free Cloud** tab shows all the free apps deployed on Mendix Cloud.

See the [Fields Glossary](#fields-glossary) section for descriptions of the table columns.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
When you select apps in the Mendix Free Cloud or the Other Apps tabs using the checkboxes in the table, a context menu appears at the bottom of the screen. Use it to deactivate, delete, or export selected apps. See the [Deactivating and Deleting Apps](#deactivate-delete-apps) section for more details.
{{% /alert %}}

## Other Apps

The **Other Apps** tab shows unlicensed apps that are not deployed and apps deployed on a Private Cloud Connected .

See the [Fields Glossary](#fields-glossary) section for descriptions of the table columns.

## Deactivated Apps

The **Deactivated Apps** tab shows all your company's deactivated apps.

See the [Fields Glossary](#fields-glossary) section for descriptions of the table columns.

When you select apps using the checkboxes in the table, a context menu appears at the bottom of the screen. Use it to activate, delete, or export selected apps. After activation, the app appears on the corresponding active tab. See the [Deactivating and Deleting Apps](#deactivate-delete-apps) section for more information.

## Filtering Apps in the Table {#filter-apps}

On each tab with a table of apps, you can find filters on the top, which allows you to view apps based on different criteria.

With the filter as shown below, you can search for string matches on any of the string fields in the table, for example, the app name or environment name.

Clicking the filter button allows you to use comparisons and string operations, such as **Contains**, **Starts with**, and **Greater than**.

{{< figure src="/attachments/control-center/apps/apps-overview/filter-apps.png" >}}

With the filter as shown below, you can filter apps by the date of the last commit. Clicking the button on the left allows you to use comparisons and string operations, such as **Between** and **Empty**. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/control-center/apps/apps-overview/filter-last-commit.png" >}}

The filter shown below allows you to filter apps by **Deployed Status**. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/control-center/apps/apps-overview/filter-mendix-cloud.png" >}}

## Viewing App Details {#app-details}

Clicking an app name in a tab or the search results opens its details page, which includes the following tabs:

* **App Info** – Shows the **Description** and **App ID**, also found in your app's [Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/).
* **Members** – Lists the team members in the app development team.
    * You can directly deactivate a team member from the app by clicking their name and selecting **Deactivate Member**.
    * For other member management options, click **Manage Members**, which will open the [Team](/developerportal/general/team/#managing) page of the app. As a Mendix Admin, you can also add yourself to a team via this page.
* **Environments** – Lists all Mendix Cloud environments. For the free Mendix Cloud environment, you can delete the environment on this tab. Once the free environment is deleted, all data will be removed. However, the app team members can still access the associated app repository in the Mendix Portal.

If the app is not a licensed app, you can see the action menu ({{% icon name="three-dots-menu-horizontal" %}}) on the upper-right corner of the page. If the app is active, then you have the options to deactivate the app and delete the app; and if the app is deactivated, then you have the options to activate the app and delete the app.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
You cannot deactivate or delete licensed apps or apps not hosted on Mendix Cloud. For the consequences of these operations, see the table in the [Deactivating and Deleting Apps](#deactivate-delete-apps) section for more information.
{{% /alert %}}

## Deactivating and Deleting Apps {#deactivate-delete-apps}

You can delete or deactivate a single app, or deactivate (or activate) multiple apps in one go.
