## Introduction

The Company Onboarding page allows you to customize the Mendix experience for your new team members to help them learn about how your company uses Mendix, where they can find resources, and how they can get started.

## Landing Page Tab

On the **Landing Page** tab of this page, you can customize your company's onboarding landing page. Once you publish it, a tile on the Mendix home page will link to your company onboarding page for all users in your company. This helps users to understand your company’s way of working on the Mendix Platform and enables them to get started more quickly. You can share your company’s best practices on Mendix Platform usage, and you can link to videos, company documentation, and other content.

You can start configuring the sections and blocks of your landing page from a standard template or from scratch. You can work on drafts and preview how the page looks before publishing for your company's new platform users.

When you configure the landing page, if you turn on the **Include company logo** toggle and the **Include company header image** toggle on the left side, and then click the **Update Company Branding** button on the top, then the **Company Logo** and **Cover Image** currently set in the [Company Brand](/control-center/company-brand/) page will be used on your landing page.

Once you publish your landing page, it will be available to all Mendix users in your company. A tile which links to the page is added to the Mendix Home page in the **Get Started with Mendix** section. The tile is called **[Your Company Name] First Steps**.

If you cannot see it, click **Customize home page** ({{% icon name="cog" %}}) on the Mendix Home page and make sure the **Get Started with Mendix** section has **Show on Home** checked.

## Onboarding Email Tab

On the **Onboarding Email** tab, you can customize the onboarding email that users of your domains receive when they join the Mendix Platform. You can provide a link to your company's onboarding page, share a welcome message, or present company guidelines for using Mendix. You can create a draft email before sending it.
