## Introduction

The **Mendix Admins** page lists all the current Mendix Admins in your company. A Mendix Admin is normally someone in the IT department of your company, and they have full access to Control Center to perform all available tasks. 

To add a new admin, click **Add Mendix Admin**.     
To remove an admin, hover over their name in the list, then click **Remove**.

If the **Add Mendix Admin** button is not displayed, your company is using a user group in your IdP to assign Mendix Admins. For more information, refer to [IdP-managed Mendix Admins](/control-center/security-settings/#idp-managed-mendix-admins).
