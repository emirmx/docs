## Introduction

If you have questions related to the Digital Execution Practice and organizational aspects:

* Reach out to your Mendix team. They are always willing to answer questions, help you make decisions, and provide extra information.  
  If you do not have a dedicated customer success manager (CSM), this guide contains the necessary resources to help you out.
* Ask the Community in our [Digital Execution Practice space](https://community.mendix.com/link/space/digital-execution-community). This is a part of the Mendix Community that is specifically dedicated to helping others succeed with their digital execution practice.  
  Your questions will be answered by our own Mendix experts, as well as other companies who have used Mendix to their benefit.

If you need help with technical matters:

* Check out the Mendix Documentation.
* Contact the [Mendix Community](https://community.mendix.com/p/questions). Here, you can get answers to your questions, and help others with their own questions.  
  Be sure to first check whether someone has already asked the question you're wondering about. If not, feel free to post it, and our community will help you out. Doing so will gain you points.
* Submit a support ticket. If something really appears to be broken from a technical point of view, such as not being able to visit or edit your app anymore, contact our [Support Team](https://support.mendix.com/hc/en-us).
