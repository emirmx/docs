## Introduction

This guide helps you unlock the full potential of the Mendix platform and accelerate the app development journey in your organization. It provides you with everything you need to know to define your low code vision, configure company-wide settings, and launch your first app.

This guide is tailored to organizations new to Mendix, and is especially geared towards leaders responsible for implementing Mendix in their company. It does not cover technical aspects, but rather focuses on how to manage organizational change, along with all the initial decisions you need to make to ensure success.

The content can be covered in a few hours. However, since it is designed as a guide, not as a course, Mendix recommends that you come back to it as you are working towards launching your first app.

After completing the steps outlined in this guide, you will be able to:

* Describe the various elements of the Mendix platform. 
* Explain the 5 P’s of the Digital Execution Practice, and how they are imperative to low-code success. 
* Create a getting-started plan. 
* Kick off your Mendix program. 
* Establish governance guidelines. 
* Prepare your first project, and onboard your first project team. 
* Launch your first app.
