## Introduction

Jira integration in the Portfolio Management Tool allows you to link [Jira projects](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/projects/overview#what-is-a-jira-project) to your [portfolio](/developerportal/portfolio-management/#portfolio-landscape). With this integration, you can assign [Jira epics](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics) from those Jira projects to [portfolio initiatives](/developerportal/portfolio-management/initiatives-overview/#create-new-initiative) and track their progress.

### Features

* Allows you to [link Jira projects to your portfolio](#link-jira-project).
* Allows you to [link Jira epics to your initiatives](/developerportal/portfolio-management/initiatives-overview/#link-epic-from-jira-project).
* Allows you to view and track progress of Jira epics linked to portfolio initiatives.

### Limitations

* Only Portfolio Managers from the same company as the portfolio can configure Jira integration and link Jira projects to a portfolio. 
* Only Portfolio Managers and Contributors from the same company as the portfolio can link Jira epics to initiatives.
* Viewers or external members cannot use Jira integration functionality.
* This integration is only one-sided. You can only display Jira information in the Portfolio Management tool and not vice versa. 

## Configuring Jira Integration {#configure-jira-integration}

As a Portfolio Manager, you can integrate your portfolio with Jira. After configuring the Jira integration, you can link Jira projects to your portfolio and link Jira epics to portfolio initiatives. Note that each portfolio requires a separate Jira integration setup.

### Prerequisites

* You need to have the Portfolio Manager role for the portfolio.
* You need to have an active subscription to [Jira Software Cloud](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/explore-jira-cloud-plans/).
* You need to have a user account and API token with access rights to the project in Jira. For more information on how to get this API token, see [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/).

### Procedure

To connect your portfolio to Jira, follow these steps:

1. In the Portfolio Management tool, [open the portfolio](/developerportal/portfolio-management/#open-portfolio) you want to integrate with Jira. 
2. Go to the [Portfolio Settings](/developerportal/portfolio-management/portfolio-settings/) page.
3. Go to the **Integrations** tab.
4. In the **Jira integration** section, click **Configure Jira Integration**.

     * **Account**: This is the login name (the email address) of a user on the Jira platform with project access rights.
     * **API Token**: This is a valid API token issued by the Jira platform and assigned to the above-mentioned account. For more information on how to get this API token, see [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/).
