The interface and functionality of these pages vary depending on where your app is deployed. For details about the various deployment options, see the [Deploying Apps](/deployment/) section.

## Environments

For supported platforms, the **Environments** page allows you to review and configure different aspects of your app. It also allows you to deploy to your chosen platform, configure individual environments, and transport your app between staging environments.

For details on the **Environments** pages for Mendix Cloud, Mendix on Kubernetes, and SAP deployments, see the following pages:

* Mendix Cloud deployments – [Environments](/developerportal/deploy/environments/)
* Mendix on Kubernetes deployments – [Deploying a Mendix App to a Mendix on Kubernetes Cluster](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-deploy/#environment-details)
* SAP deployments – [SAP Business Technology Platform](/developerportal/deploy/sap-cloud-platform/#EnvironmentDetails)

Other platforms are not currently supported on the **Environments** page; instead, you must go to the relevant platform portal to monitor and configure your environments.

## Pipelines

The **Pipelines** page is for licensed apps deployed to Mendix Cloud, Mendix on Kubernetes, and Mendix on Azure. For more information, see [Mendix Pipelines](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-pipelines/).

## Backups

The **Backups** page is for apps deployed to Mendix Cloud. For more information, see [Backups](/developerportal/operate/backups/).

If your app is deployed to SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) instead, the **Backups** page links to the SAP BTP cockpit. 

## Mobile App

On the **Mobile App** page, you can manage and publish your app in mobile app stores. For more details, see [Mobile App](/developerportal/deploy/mobileapp/).

## Webhooks

The **Webhooks** page is for licensed apps that are deployed to Mendix Cloud or Mendix on Kubernetes. For more information, see [Webhooks](/developerportal/deploy/webhooks/).
