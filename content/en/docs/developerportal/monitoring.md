## Introduction

The **Monitoring** category in the [navigation pane](/developerportal/#navigation-pane) of **Apps** provides access to software composition, alerts, logs, and metrics.

## Software Composition

The **Software Composition** page is for Free Apps and licensed apps running in Mendix Cloud or Mendix on Kubernetes. For more information, see [Software Composition](/developerportal/deploy/software-composition/).

## Alerts

The **Alerts** page is for licensed apps deployed to Mendix Cloud. Alerts are not available for Free Apps deployed to Mendix Cloud. For more information, see [Alerts](/developerportal/operate/monitoring-application-health/).

If your app is deployed to SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) instead, the **Alerts** page links to the SAP BTP cockpit. 

## Logs

To configure logs if your app is running on a different cloud, go to the cloud management portal for the cloud to which your app is deployed. For more information, see [Monitoring Environments in Mendix on Kubernetes](/developerportal/deploy/private-cloud-monitor/) or [Monitoring Environments in Mendix Apps on SAP BTP](/developerportal/deploy/sap-cloud-platform/sap-monitoring/).
