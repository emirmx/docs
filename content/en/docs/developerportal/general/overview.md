## Introduction

Located in the [navigation pane](/developerportal/#navigation-pane) of **Apps**, **Overview** lets you see your app activity and see the most important project information at a glance.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/general/overview/app-overview.png" >}}

At the top of the page, you can find the following key information about your app:

* The logo, name, and description of the app.    
    If no description is provided, there is a placeholder text.    
    If you have the **App Settings** permission, you can change the logo, name, and description of the app on the [Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/) page.

In the panel on the right hand side of the page, you can find the following information about your app:

* The size of your **Team** and your team members. Up to 5 team members can be displayed here at a time.
* The name of the **Company** owning the app.
* The **Deployment Provider** where your app is deployed, and, if the target is the public Mendix Cloud, the **License State** of the app.
* The date of the **Last Commit to the Main Line** of your app. This is only available if you have access to the app on the Team Server.
* The **Mendix Version** of your app on main line. This is only available if you have access to the app on the Team Server.

Click **Invite someone to your team** ({{% icon name="add-circle" %}}) to invite new members to your team directly.
