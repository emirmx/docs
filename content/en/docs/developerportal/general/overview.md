## Introduction

Located in the [navigation pane](/developerportal/#navigation-pane) of **Apps**, **Overview** lets you see your app activity and the most important information about your project at a glance.

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/general/overview/overview.png" >}}

At the top of the page, you will find key information about your app, such as its logo, name, and description. If no description is provided, there is a placeholder text. With the **App Settings** permission, you can change the logo, name, and description of the app on the [Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/) page.

On the right side of the page, you can find the following information about your app:

* The size of your **Team** and your team members. Up to 5 team members can be displayed here at a time.
* The name of the **Company** owning the app.
* The **Deployment Provider** where your app is deployed, and, if the target is the public Mendix Cloud, the **License State** of the app.
* The date of the **Last Commit to the Main Line** of your app. This is only available if you have access to the app on the Team Server.
* The **Mendix Version** of your app on main line. This is only available if you have access to the app on the Team Server.

Click **Invite someone to your team** ({{% icon name="add-circle" %}}) to invite new members to your team directly. 

Click **View All Members** to go to the application's [Team](/developerportal/general/team/) page.
