## Introduction

The global navigation top bar and menu work the same in **Apps** as they do in other browser-based parts of the Mendix Portal (for example, [Mendix Marketplace](/appstore/) and [Mendix Catalog](/catalog/)). 

The global navigation is always accessible throughout the online Mendix Platform.

## Global Navigation Menu {#global-navigation}

On the left side of the top bar, click **Open Global Navigation** ({{% icon name="layout-rounded-1" %}}) to access the main menu:

Click the menu items to navigate to different parts of the Mendix Platform, or hover over the menu items to expand the sections for further access.

## Search

In the **Search** box, you can search the platform for **Docs**, **Forum** posts, public **Marketplace** content, and **Academy** content.

Use the various filters to refine your search results:

To stop receiving notifications when new feedback is submitted for a specific app, go to the [Settings](/developerportal/collaborate/general-settings/) page for that app and click **Stop Watching**. To disable notifications for multiple apps on one page, use the **Stop Watching** option on the [My Apps](/developerportal/#my-apps) page.

## Maia in Mendix Portal {#maia-mx-portal}

Mendix AI Assistance (Maia) refers to Mendix Platform capabilities that leverage [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.mendix.com/glossary/artificial-intelligence-ai/) and [machine learning (ML)](https://www.mendix.com/glossary/machine-learning/) to assist developers in application development. Maia is designed to help development teams in modeling and delivering Mendix applications faster, more consistently, and with higher quality.

Below are the Maia capabilities that are available in Mendix Portal:

* **Maia Chat**  – a built-in chat interface, for more information, see the [Maia Chat](#maia-chat) section below.
* **Maia Rewrite** – an AI-assisted writing aid integrated within the Mendix Community posting interface, which helps you to ask properly-formatted questions that are more likely to be answered. For more information on how to use it, see the [Asking Your Question](/community-tools/mendix-community/#asking-question) section in *Mendix Community*.
* **Maia Summarize** – an AI-assisted summarizing aid which condenses lengthy discussions for a question posted on Mendix Community into key points, making it easier for you to find solutions to your questions without having to plough through every single answer in the thread.
