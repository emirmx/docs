## Introduction

If your app uses the [Mendix Feedback](/appstore/modules/mendix-feedback/) module, users can report feedback to your team using the feedback widget in your app, and all their feedback goes to the **Feedback** page. **Feedback** enables your team to view all the feedback. It also allows team members with the right permissions to organize feedback and add feedback manually. 

You can access the **Feedback** page by selecting your app in [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/), then clicking **Feedback** in the navigation pane. 

The **Feedback** page contains two tabs: [Inbox](#inbox) and [Archive](#archive).

### What Happens to a User After They Submit Feedback? {#what-happens-to-user}

#### What Happens to Your Team

After a user reports feedback in the app using the feedback widget, the feedback goes automatically to the [Inbox](#inbox) on the **Feedback** page, and the members in your team who are a Scrum Master or have the same permissions as the default permissions of a Scrum Master get a [notification](/portal/global-navigation/#notifications). If you no longer want to receive feedback notifications for a specific app, you can [stop watching](/developerportal/#my-apps) the app. 

On top of getting a notification in the Mendix Portal, Scrum Masters of your team also receive an email with a link to the details of the new feedback.

#### What Happens to the User

After a user reports feedback in the app using the feedback widget, they get an email with a link to their submitted feedback. When the user opens the link, a page opens and shows their feedback details.

##### What a User Can See on the Page

* Name of the feedback they submitted 
* Description of the feedback they wrote 
* Screenshot (if they uploaded a screenshot for the feedback)
* Current status of the feedback
* Submission date
* Last activity on the feedback 

##### What a User Cannot See on the Page

* Metadata
* Summary of the feedback that your team wrote
* To which team member the feedback is assigned 
* Tags that are assigned to the feedback
* Other feedback that is associated to this feedback
* Attachments that you team uploaded for this feedback
* Team comments on this feedback

This page also has a message feature for the user to communicate with your team directly. Users can upload images in the messages. When the user posts a message, the assigned team member receives an email. When there is a reply from your team, the user gets an email notification.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}Do not share the link to feedback details with someone unless it is necessary. Anyone who has this link can access the feedback details, including the title and the description of the feedback, as well as the screenshot if there is one.{{% /alert %}}

If the user does not want to receive notifications anymore, they can clear the checkbox for the notification on the page.
