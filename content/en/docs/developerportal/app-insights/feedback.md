## 1 Introduction

If your app uses the [Mendix Feedback](/appstore/modules/mendix-feedback/) module, users can report feedback to your team using the feedback widget in your app, and all their feedback will go to the **Feedback** page. **Feedback** enables your team to view all the feedback items. It also allows team members with the right permissions to organize the feedback items, and add feedback items manually. 

You can access the **Feedback** page by selecting your app in the Developer Portal and then clicking **Feedback** in the navigation pane. 

The **Feedback** page contains two tabs: [Inbox](#inbox) and [Archive](#archive).

### 1.1 What Happens to a User After They Submit Feedback? {#what-happens-to-user}

#### 1.1.1 What Happens to Your Team

After a user reports feedback in the app using the feedback widget, the feedback item goes automatically to the [Inbox](#inbox) on the **Feedback** page, and the members in your team who are a Scrum Master or have the same permissions as the default permissions of a Scrum Master will get a [notification](/developerportal/global-navigation/#notifications). If you no longer want to receive feedback notifications for a specific app, you can [stop watching](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/#my-apps) the app. 

Next to getting a notification in the Developer Portal, Scrum Masters of your team will also receive an email with a link to the details of the new feedback item.

#### 1.1.2 What Happens to the User

After a user reports feedback in the app using the feedback widget, the user will get an email with a link to their submitted feedback item. When the user opens the link, a page opens and shows their feedback details. See the table below:

| What a User Can See on the Page                             | What a User Cannot See on the Page                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name of the feedback they submitted                         | Metadata                                                     |
| Description of the feedback they wrote                      | Summary of the feedback that your team wrote                 |
| Screenshot (if they uploaded a screenshot for the feedback) | To which team member the feedback item is assigned           |
| Current status of the feedback item                         | Tags that are assigned to the feedback item                  |
| Submission date                                             | Other feedback items that are associated with this feedback item |
| Last activity on the feedback item                          | Attachments that you team uploaded for this feedback item    |
|                                                             | Team comments on this feedback item                          |

This page also has a message feature for the user to communicate with your team directly. Users can upload images in the messages. When the user posts a message, the assigned team member will receive an email. When there is a reply from your team, the user will get an email notification.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}Do not share the link to feedback details with someone unless it is necessary. Anyone who has this link can access the feedback details, including the title and the description of the feedback item as well as the screenshot if there is one.{{% /alert %}}

If the user does not want to receive notifications anymore, they can clear the checkbox for the notification on the page, as shown in the image below: 

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/app-insights/feedback/user-notification.png" >}}

## 2 Inbox {#inbox}

On the **Inbox** tab, everyone from your team can view all the unarchived feedback items that have been sent from your app by users.  

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/app-insights/feedback/feedback-items.png" class="image-border" alt="inbox tab" >}}

In the list on the **Inbox** tab, you can find the following information for each feedback item:

To export all feedback items into one Excel file, click **Export**.

Clicking the filter bar will open the **Filter by** side panel. In this side panel, you can filter the feedback items using the **Environment**, **Assignee**, **Priority**, **Status**, and **Submission date**. The filters are saved until the page is refreshed.

### 2.1 Organizing Feedback Items in Inbox

If your [role](/developerportal/general/app-roles/) has the permission that **Can edit ‘Stories, Documents and Feedback'**, you can also organize feedback items.

You can add new feedback items manually yourself. 

To manually add a feedback item, click **Create new feedback item** (if there is not any feedback item yet on the **Inbox** tab) or click **Add item** (if there are already feedback items on the **Inbox** tab), and then fill in the **Subject**, **Description**, and **Submitter Email** fields, and optionally **Upload Screenshots** in the **New Feedback item** dialog box.

If you select feedback items, you can see the following items: 

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/app-insights/feedback/bulk-actions-bar.png" class="image-border" alt="bulk-actions-bar" >}}

* **Link Items** – Clicking this links the feedback items together into one feedback group.

  You need to choose which item is the primary item of the group. After the feedback items are linked, only the primary feedback item appears in the list. The feedback items that are linked to the primary item will disappear from the list. You can only access these linked feedback items from their primary item. If you change the status of the primary feedback item, all the linked items will get the same status automatically.

  {{% alert color="info" %}}When you open a linked feedback item, you can click **Make [the linked feedback item] the Primary Item** to make this feedback item the primary item of the feedback group instead.{{% /alert %}}

* **Move** – Clicking this moves the selected feedback items to any other app of which you are a member. Whenever you move feedback items, you will also move all linked feedback. If you only want to move one feedback item, you need to unlink the feedback item from the group first.

* **Create Stories** – If your app is connected to [Epics](/developerportal/project-management/epics/) or [Jira](/developerportal/project-management/jira-connector/), clicking this button will convert the selected feedback items to stories on the designated board in Epics or Jira.

* **Archive** – Clicking this sets the selected feedback items as archived.

* **Delete** – Clicking this deletes the selected feedback items permanently. The result is irreversible.

## 2 Archive {#archive}

On the **Archive** tab, everyone in your team can view all the archived feedback items.

In the list on the **Archive** tab, you can find the following information for each feedback item:

* **ID** – the unique number that is assigned to the feedback item
* **Subject** – the title of the feedback item given by the reporter
* **Submitter** – the email address of the reporter
* **Tags** – tags that your team has assigned to the feedback item
* **Status** – the status that your team has set to the feedback item
* **Date** – the date when the feedback was submitted
* **Archive Date** – the date when the feedback was archived

To export all the archived feedback items into one Excel file, click **Export**.

To search by **Subject** and **ID**, type the keywords in the search bar.

Clicking the filter bar will open the **Filter by** side panel. In this side panel, you can filter the feedback items using the **Environment**, **Closed date**, **Submission date**, and **Assignees**. The filters are saved until the page is refreshed.

## 3 Opening a Feedback Item in Inbox or Archive{#feedback-details}

On the [Inbox](#inbox) and [Archive](#archive) tabs, you can open a feedback item by clicking it in the list. If you click the **ID** of a feedback item, the feedback details page will open. If you click a place other than the **ID** of a feedback item, a side panel will open. Either the feedback details page or the side panel contains two tabs: [Feedback](#feedback) and [Contact Reporter](#contact-reporter).

### 3.1 Feedback Tab {#feedback}

The **Contact Reporter** tab allows you to read messages from the reporter and reply to them. Whenever the reporter sends a message, it will be shown in this section. Once you reply a message from the reporter, they will receive an email. When there are multiple feedback items linked, the system only sends an email to the reporter of this specific feedback item, not other associated items in the same group.
