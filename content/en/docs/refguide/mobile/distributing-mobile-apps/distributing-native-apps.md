## Introduction

To create a mobile app, you need platform-specific app signing keys. A mobile app is signed with a digital signature by its developers before publication. These signatures are used by both app stores and devices to verify that the app is authentic.

Depending on which platforms you want to target, you will need to create the required signing keys. The following sections describe (per platform) how to create those keys.

## iOS{#ios}

Unfortunately, signing keys are always required for iOS app deployment, even if you just want to test the app on your personal device and do not want to publish to the Apple App Store. This section describes how to create the required files.

It is convenient to have an Apple Mac available, but it is not a requirement. You do always need an Apple Developer Account.

### On Apple Macs

If you have an Apple Mac available, see the Apple developer documentation on [certificate management](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingCertificates/MaintainingCertificates.html) for information on how to obtain an iOS signing certificate and distribution profile. Next, see the Apple documentation on [how to create the required distribution profile](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingProfiles/MaintainingProfiles.html). 

### On Other Platforms

If you do not have an Apple Mac available, you can create a certificate signing request manually. First, create a private key and certificate signing request with the OpenSSL utility. For more information on OpenSSL, browse these resources:

* [OpenSSL Documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl.html)
* [Install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

The following steps assume you have a Windows machine, but these are equally applicable to Linux machines, which usually have the OpenSSL package pre-installed.

To create a certificate signing request manually, follow these steps:

1. Download the LTS [OpenSSL for Windows](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) and install it. You just need to download and install the **Win64 OpenSSL Light** package (get the latest version at the top of the list).
    * If the setup process complains about a missing VC++ redistributable libraries package, cancel the installation, and first download and install the **Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables** from the same list of packages (you will be redirected to a Microsoft download page). Install OpenSSL to, for example, *C:\OpenSSL* (make note of this directory, as you will need it in step 3).
2. Open a command line interface (CLI) such as Command Prompt. On most systems, you need to do this as an administrator (right-click the Windows start menu link and select **Run as Administrator**).
3. Generate a private key with the OpenSSL program that you just installed. Replace `C:\OpenSSL` with where you installed OpenSSL in step 1. The private key file is stored at the location specified after the `-out` parameter. The following example will store the file in the root directory of your C: drive (you can change this to anything you want, just select a convenient place and keep track of where the file is stored): `"C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl.exe" genrsa -out "C:\private.key" 2048`. The command will output "Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus" and lots of dots and plus signs.
4. Generate a certificate signing request (CSR). The file is again stored in the same folder, but can be placed anywhere. Make sure to point to the private key file that was created in the previous step: `"C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl.exe" req -new -key "C:\private.key" -out "C:\ios.csr"`. The command will print some text and then ask you for several different pieces of information related to your identity. Only the **Common Name** is relevant. Fill in your own name, so that the certificate is easily recognized later on after uploading it to the Apple Developer Member Center.
5. Keep your CLI open.

The resulting *ios.csr* file must be uploaded to the Apple Developer Member Center to generate a signed certificate. Follow these steps to do that:

1. In the Apple Developer Member Center click [Create a New Certificate](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add).
2. Under **Software**, select **iOS App Development**.
3. Click **Continue** again. You are now at the **Create a New Certificate** step.
4. Under **Upload a Certificate Signing Request**, click **Choose File**.
5. Select the *ios.csr* certificate signing request file that you created.
6. Click **Continue**. Apple will sign your CSR and make the signed certificate available for download.
    * If you are presented with a message that says that your certificate signing request is pending approval, you do not have the required access rights. Ask your company account administrator to approve your certificate signing request.
7. Click **Download** and store the *.cer* file on your disk at a convenient place (for example, next to the private key and CSR files).
8. Click **Done**. The **iOS Certificates** overview page becomes visible again. Your new certificate should be in the list. Here, you can download it again, or you can revoke it (in case you lose the corresponding private key).

The downloaded *ios_development.cer* and *private.key* file must now be packaged:

1. Return to your CLI.
2. Convert the downloaded certificate to *pem* format with this command: `"C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl.exe" x509 -in "C:\ios_development.cer" -inform der -out "C:\ios_development.pem"`.
3. Package your private key and certificate. The command will ask you for a password for the package: `"C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl.exe" pkcs12 -export -inkey "C:\private.key" -in "C:\ios_development.pem" -out "C:\key_and_certificate.p12"`. The same password will be used later by the Mendix Native Mobile Builder.

The resulting *key_and_certificate.p12* will be used by the Mendix Native Mobile Builder to sign your apps.

### Creating the Required Distribution Profile

Once you have the certificate file, you need to obtain a distribution profile. The Apple Developer Member Center allows you to define an app identifier, a test device, and finally a distribution profile. For more information, check the Apple documentation on how to [maintain identifiers, devices and profiles](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/create-order-type-identifiers-and-certificates/).

## Android{#android}

Android apps can be developed and deployed to Android devices without signing the apps. However, to publish to app stores, signed apps are required.

### Generating a Keystore {#generating-a-keystore}

To generate a keystore for Android, follow these steps:

1. Install Java JDK either for Mac or Windows. Remember where you installed your JDK, as the JDK bin folder will be used later.
2. Open your **Command Prompt** and run your new *keytool.exe* located in your JDKâ€™s bin folder.
3. The *keytool.exe* program can be found in the bin directory of your Java installation (for example: *C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_20\bin*):

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/mobile/managing-app-signing-keys/cmdjdkexe.png" alt="keytool location" class="no-border" >}}

4. Type in the following command line prompt while still pointing to the *keystore.exe*: 

    ```powershell
    "{{keytool -genkey -v -keystore file.keystore -alias YOUR_ALIAS_NAME -storepass YOUR_ALIAS_PWD -keypass YOUR_ALIAS_PWD -keyalg RSA -validity 36500}}"
    ```

    Be sure to replace `YOUR_ALIAS_NAME` and `YOUR_ALIAS_PWD` with your alias name and password:

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/mobile/managing-app-signing-keys/ktoolsetup.png" alt="name and password" class="no-border" >}}

5. Answer the subsequent questions, click **Enter** after each question, and type *yes* when asked to confirm your information: 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/mobile/managing-app-signing-keys/qanda.png" alt="info questions" class="no-border" >}}

6. Finishing these questions generates a keystore which will be saved into a *file.keystore* file in your current working directory. 


## Building a Release App {#building-release}

Once your signing credentials are ready, you can build the signed release version of your app using Xcode (for iOS) or Android Studio (for Android).

### iOS (Xcode)

To build your iOS app in Xcode, do the following:

1. Open your project in Xcode (this can be generated by the Mendix Native Builder).
1. In the project navigator, select your app target.
1. Go to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab and ensure your team and provisioning profile are set.
1. Choose **Any iOS Device (arm64)** in the device target dropdown.
1. Go to the **Product** menu and select **Archive**.
1. When the archive is complete, the **Organizer** window will open.
1. From there, you can export the *.ipa* file by selecting **Distribute App** > **App Store Connect** or **Ad Hoc**, depending on your goal.
1. Follow the steps to export the *.ipa* file or upload it directly to App Store Connect 

Once you finish the final step, the exported *.ipa* file is usually located under `"~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/DATE/YOUR-APP.xcarchive"` (with the publish date and name of your app instead of DATE and YOUR-APP).

### Android (Android Studio)

To build an Android app in Android Studio, do the following:

1. Open the android directory of your Mendix Native project in Android Studio.
1. Select Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK from the top menu.
1. Choose APK or Android App Bundle (AAB).
1. Follow the wizard and choose your keystore file, alias, and password.
1. Select release as the build variant.
1. Complete the wizard and wait for Android Studio to build the release file.

Once you finish the final step, the output *.apk* or *.aab* file will be located in one of two places (with the name of your project instead of YOUR-PROJECT):

* `"YOUR-PROJECT/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk"`
* `"~YOUR-PROJECT/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab"`

## Publishing to App Stores {#publishing}

### iOS â€“ App Store Connect

To publish in the iOS App Store, do the following:

1. Log into App Store Connect.
1. Create a new app record if this is your first time submitting.
1. Upload the *.ipa* file directly from Xcode or by using Transporter (a free tool from Apple).
1. Fill in all required metadata, screenshots, and compliance information.
1. Submit your app for review.

Make sure your Apple Developer Account is active and the app has passed validation before submission.

### Android â€“ Google Play Console

To publish in the Android Google Play Console, do the following:

1. Go to the Google Play Console.
1. Create a new application and fill in the store listing information.
1. Navigate to the **Release** > **Production** > **Create Release section**.
1. Upload your signed *.apk* or *.aab* file.
1. Review and roll out your release to production.

Be sure to enroll in Google Play App Signing if you plan to use AAB files. Also, donâ€™t forget to set up content rating, privacy policies, and testing tracks if needed.
