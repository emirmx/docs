## Introduction

Client side encryption for S3 can be enabled by specifying encryption keys with the `com.mendix.storage.s3.EncryptionKeys` setting. This setting allows you to specify multiple keys. 
The last encryption key will be used for encrypting new files. When retrieving a file the correct encryption key will be used from the list of encryption keys.

For deployments to Mendix Cloud, SAP BTP, and Mendix on Kubernetes, these encryption keys are managed for you and cannot be changed.

## Implementing Key Rotation

When a new key is added, that key will be used for newly encrypted files but existing files will *not* be automatically re-encrypted. For this you need to implement re-encryption inside your application.
This can be done by adding a new encryption key and then re-uploading all existing files.

The following is a Java action that demonstrates re-uploading a list of files:

```java
public class JA_RefreshFileContents extends UserAction<java.lang.Void>
{
  …
  private final java.util.List<IMendixObject> __files;

  …
  public java.lang.Void executeAction() throws Exception
  {
    // BEGIN USER CODE
    IContext sc = Core.createSystemContext();
    sc.startTransaction();
    __files.stream().forEach(f -> { f.setValue(sc, "Contents", (java.io.InputStream) f.getValue(sc, "Contents")); });
    sc.endTransaction();
    Core.commit(sc, __files);
    return null;
    // END USER CODE
  }

  …
}
```

This Java action can be repeatedly called from a microflow that reads objects of type `System.FileDocument`' in batches. For example, see the following microflow:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/runtime/custom-settings/batch-file-update-microflow.png" class="no-border" alt="Microflow which contains a loop which retrieves a list of FileDocument objects and rewrites them to rotate the encryption key." >}}

Here a list of FileDocument objects is retrieved, for example 100, ordered by the `FileID` attribute, and passed to the `JA_RefreshFileContents` Java action. This is repeated until all the files are processed. We store the last processed file's `FileID` attribute in case the process gets interrupted. This microflow can be executed in a task queue.
