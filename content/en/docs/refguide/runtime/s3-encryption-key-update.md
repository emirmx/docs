## Introduction

Client side encryption for S3 can be enabled by specifying encryption keys with the `com.mendix.storage.s3.EncryptionKeys` setting. This setting allows specifying multiple keys. 
The last encryption key will be used for encrypting new files. When retrieving a file the correct encryption key will be used from the list of encryption keys.

### Implementing Key Rotation
When a new key is added, that key will be used for newly encrypted files but existing files will *not* be automatically re-encrypted. For this you need to implement re-encryption inside your application.
This can be done by adding a new encryption key and then re-uploading all existing files.

The following is a Java action that demonstrates re-uploading a list of files:

```java
public class JA_RefreshFileContents extends UserAction<java.lang.Void>
{
  ...
  private final java.util.List<IMendixObject> __files;

  ...
  public java.lang.Void executeAction() throws Exception
  {
    // BEGIN USER CODE
    IContext sc = Core.createSystemContext();
    sc.startTransaction();
    __files.stream().forEach(f -> { f.setValue(sc, "Contents", (java.io.InputStream) f.getValue(sc, "Contents")); });
    sc.endTransaction();
    Core.commit(sc, __files);
    return null;
    // END USER CODE
  }

  ...
}
```

This Java action can be repeatedly called from a microflow that reads `System.FileDocument`'s in batches like the following:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide9/runtime/batch-file-update-microflow.png" class="no-border" >}}

Here a batch of files is retrieved, e.g. 100, ordered by `FileID` attribute, and passed to the `JA_RefreshFileContents` Java action. This is repeated until all the files are processed. We store last processed file's `FileID` attribute in case the process gets interrupted. This microflow can be executed in a task queue.
