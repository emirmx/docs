**Start with Maia** is a starting point in Studio Pro that helps you to start the app development process. Based on a required text description and an optional image or PDF, it generates an app that includes a domain model, data management overview pages, test data, and a tailored homepage. Once the app is generated, you can choose to either immediately run the app locally and preview the generated pages with randomly generated test data, or continue building in Studio Pro. It offers you a quick way to get started with your app development.
