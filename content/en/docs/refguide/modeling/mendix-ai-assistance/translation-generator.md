For more information on how to enable and use this AI translation tool in Studio Pro, see the sections below.

## Modeling Using Translation Generator

Translation Generator helps you to translate your model to different languages. It gives translations for the languages that you have selected, using parameters in the way that works specifically for the selected languages.

Translation Generator only translates the texts that do not have a translation yet, so only when their corresponding **Translation** field is empty.

After clicking **Generate Translations...**, you will be asked to confirm your choice and be advised to review the generated translations.

Once translations are generated, you need to Click **Translate** to save the changes. You can then go to the next language to translate further.

Currently, if you encounter an error after clicking **Generate Translations...**, try to sign out and sign in to Studio Pro again.

### Generating Translation for System Texts {#translate-system-text}

You can also use Translation Generator in the web version of the [system texts](/refguide/system-texts/) editor. 

The web-based system texts editor is currently an experimental feature. You can enable it via **Preferences** > the **New Features** tab > the **System Texts Editor** section.

After enabling the new editor and Translation Generator, make sure to restart Studio Pro. You will then see the **Generate translation** option from **App Explorer** > **App '*APP_NAME*'** > **System texts**.

It generates translation for the system texts based on what the [current language](/refguide/translatable-texts/#current-language) is for app end-users.
