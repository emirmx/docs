## Introduction 

Mendix AI Assistance (Maia) refers to Mendix Platform capabilities that leverage [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.mendix.com/glossary/artificial-intelligence-ai/) and [machine learning (ML)](https://www.mendix.com/glossary/machine-learning/) to assist developers in application development. Maia is designed to help development teams in modeling and delivering Mendix applications faster, more consistently, and with higher quality. 

Mendix developers can use Maia to get guidance by asking questions, get recommendation and assistance for certain development tasks, and even generate part of their app.

## Maia Capabilities in Mendix Studio Pro 

Mendix AI Assistance (Maia) in Studio Pro has the following capabilities: 

Guidance:

* **Maia Chat** – a built-in chat interface powered by Generative AI in Studio Pro. It answers questions about app development in Mendix, including how to apply concepts, best practices, and development patterns. For more information, see [Maia Chat](/refguide/maia-chat/). 
* **Maia Learn** – helps you to quickly learn Mendix core concepts and get started with Studio Pro. For more information, see [Maia Learn](/refguide/maia-learn/).
* **Maia Explain** – helps you easily understand a microflow or a nanoflow. It explains the general purpose of the logic and highlights specific technical details to help you understand the logic further. For more information, see [Maia Explain](/refguide/maia-explain/).

Recommenders:

* **Best Practice Recommender** – helps you inspect your app against Mendix development best practice detecting and pinpointing development anti-patterns and, in some cases, automatically fixing them. For more information, see [Best Practice Recommender](/refguide/best-practice-recommender/).
* **Logic Recommender** – helps you model and configure microflows, nanoflows, and rules in Mendix Studio Pro. It gives you contextualized recommendations on the next best activity based on the activities and parameters that are already configured in your application. For more information, see [Logic Recommender](/refguide/logic-recommender/).
* **UI Recommender** – helps you easily add new widgets to a page in Mendix Studio Pro without losing the context of what you are currently working on. For more information, see [UI Recommender](/refguide/ui-recommender/).
* **Workflow Recommender** – helps you model and configure workflows in Mendix Studio Pro. It gives you contextualized recommendations on the next best activity in your workflow based on context-related information. For more information, see [Workflow Recommender](/refguide/workflow-recommender/).

Generators:

* **Maia for Domain Model** – helps you generate new [domain models](/refguide/domain-model/), and explain and provide suggestions for existing domain models. For more information, see [Maia for Domain Model](/refguide/maia-for-domain-model/).
* **Maia for Pages** – helps you generate a [page](/refguide/page/). It helps you add and configure widgets based on a text input and an optional image. After a page is generated, you can continue in the same session to ask Maia for further improvements and explanations. For more information, see [Maia for Pages](/refguide/maia-for-pages/).
* **Maia for OQL** – helps you generate and manage OQL (Object Query Language) queries through an intuitive interface. It is designed to simplify query creation and reduce manual effort. For more information, see [Maia for OQL](/refguide/maia-for-oql/).
* **Maia for Workflows** – helps you generate a [Workflow](/refguide/workflows/). By providing a use case via text input or an image, Maia can help you start creating your workflows. For more information, see [Maia for Workflows](/refguide/maia-for-workflows/).
* **Translation Generator** – helps you with [batch translate](/refguide/translation-generator/#batch-translate) and [translating system texts](/refguide/translation-generator/#translate-system-text) in the web-based system texts editor. For more information, see [Translation Generator](/refguide/translation-generator/).
