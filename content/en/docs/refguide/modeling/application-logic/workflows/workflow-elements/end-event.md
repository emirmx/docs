## Introduction

An **End Event** in workflows defines where a workflow process ends. When the workflow execution reaches this element, the process is completed and no further actions are taken.

A workflow can have multiple end events, as shown in the example below:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/application-logic/workflows/workflow-elements/end-event/multiple-end-events.png" alt="End Event Example" width="400" >}}

This example shows a decision element, where the workflow can take two different paths based on a condition. Each path leads to a different end event, either of which ends the process. In addition, there is an interrupting boundary event on one of the user tasks, with its own end event. In all of these cases, there is only one path that will be taken, and the process will end when it reaches the corresponding end event.

## Properties

The **End Event** does not have any properties.
