## Introduction

The **Query External Database** activity is used with the [External Database Connector](/appstore/modules/external-database-connector/) to use preconfigured database queries and display retrieved data in your app.

This document covers the properties of the **Query External Database** activity. 

To learn how to use this activity in a microflow and configure other aspects of the Database connector, see the [Configuration](/appstore/modules/external-database-connector/#configuration) section of *External Database Connector*.

## Properties

Prior to Mendix 11.3.0, some of these properties were grouped in different sections.

Double-click the **Query External Database** activity to view its properties.

The **General** section contains the following properties, which are used to provide dynamic connection parameter values:

* **Database** – the name of the database you want to query

* **Connection Parameters**
    * **DBSource** – Enter the JDBC URL you want to use for connection during runtime
    * **DBUsername** – Enter the username you want to use for connection during runtime
    * **DBPassword** – Enter the password you want to use for connection during runtime

    If you are using SSL based authentication for Postgres, provide the value for

    * **ClientCertificateIdentifier**

    If you are using key-pair authentication for Snowflake, provide the value for:

    * **PrivateKey**
    * **Passphrase**

The **Query** section contains the following properties:

* **Query** – the saved SQL query from your configuration of the Database connector
* **Dynamic** – Choose **Yes** to update the query—*this option is available in Mendix 11.3.0 and above*
    * **SQL** – When **Yes** is selected, the SQL field appears prepopulated with the selected query. You can then modify this query, using variables and parameters if required.
* **Parameters** – the saved parameters from your configuration of the Database connector

In the **Output** section are the following properties:

* **Return type** – the return type once the microflow is completed
* **Use return value** – select **Yes** or **No**
    * **List name** – if **Use return value** is set to **Yes**, this is the name of the returned list

It is your responsibility to apply the proper security, as this action can allow for SQL injection into your application. Do not use user-supplied or environment-supplied variables in your SQL statement; if possible, you should prefer them to be static.
