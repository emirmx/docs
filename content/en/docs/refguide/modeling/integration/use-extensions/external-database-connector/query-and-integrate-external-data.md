## Introduction

Use the [External Database Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/219862) to connect, retrieve, and insert data into your Mendix app.

This document teaches you how to do the following:

* Connect your Mendix App to an external database
* Create and validate SQL queries
* Use created queries in the **Query External Database** activity

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have an active connection using the External Database Connection document. For information on how to configure the connector, see [External Database Connector](/appstore/modules/external-database-connector/) in the *Marketplace Guide*. 

* If additional connection properties are required to connect, you can alternatively use **JDBC Connection String**.
* If certificate-based authentication is required for PostgreSQL connections, ensure that all necessary certificates are added before running the app.
* To test the connection and execute queries during design time, ensure to run your app locally.

## Create and Validate SQL Queries with Parameters

1. Create a new query by entering an SQL query in the **SQL query** field.

2. Open the **Parameters** tab and click **Add Parameter** if you want to use constants or variables in your query during runtime. Use curly braces to include a parameter in the query. 

3. Assign a Test Value to each parameter.

4. Click **Run Query** to validate the query and view the response.

For example, the query below retrieves a list of RequestedProductRequirement where the ProductLine is **Planes**.

```sql
`Select requestedProductRequirement from productlines where productLine = {productLine}`
```

### Typecast Parameter Data Type

You can typecast `String` into UUID, as shown below:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/13.png" width="700" >}}

## Save Query

### Save Query to Retrieve Data

1. Click **Use Response** to view the response data and mapping.

2. In the **Response Structure** tab, you can choose **New Entity** or **Reuse Entity**.

   a. If **New Entity** is selected, you can view the entity in the **Response structure** tab. Click **Save Query & Create Entity** to save the query and the newly created entity in the domain model. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/5.png" width="600" >}}

   b. If **Reuse Entity** is selected, all entities mapped to other queries of same document are listed in the drop-down list. Select the entity you want to reuse and click **Save Query**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/5a.png" width="600" >}}

### Save DML Query

1. For DML queries, *Number of affected rows* will be displayed as a response.

    For example, `INSERT INTO classicmodels.productlines(productLine, requestedProductRequirement)VALUES({productLine}, {requestedProductRequirement})`

2. Click **Save Query**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/6.png" width="600" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}} For all DML Queries, changes made to database in the Mendix Design phase are automatically rolled back. {{% /alert %}}

## Update Existing Query

You can use the existing entity when updating a existing query.

For example, you can modify the query below to retrieve a list of `productLine`, `textDescription`, and `htmlDescription` columns from `productLines` where the `productLine` is **Planes**.

SQL Query:
Existing Query: `Select requestedProductRequirement from productlines where productLine = {productLine}`
Modified Query: `Select productLine, textDescription, htmlDescription from productlines where productLine = {productLine}`

Do the following:

1. Rerun the query to see the **Response data**.

2. Click **Use Response** to see the entity preview.

3. Use the existing entity or create a new entity.

   a. If **New Entity** is selected, you can view the entity in the **Response structure** tab. Click **Save Query & Create Entity** to save the query and the newly created entity in the domain model.

   b. If **Update Entity** is selected, you can see changes that will be made to the existing entity. Click **Update Entity** to save the query and the changes made to the entity in the domain model.

## Call Stored Procedure

To call a stored procedure, do the following:

1. Select the **Stored procedure** checkbox.

2. Enter the query to call a stored procedure. Add a schema name with the stored procedure name. For example, use the following syntax, where `latest_schema` is the schema name, and `InsertDataIntoTable1` is the stored procedure: `Call latest_schema.InsertDataIntoTable1({1},{2})`. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/9.png" width="600" >}}

3. Create **IN**, **OUT**, and **INOUT** parameters for all parameters present in the stored procedure. Make sure the **Name in DB** is the same as the name of parameter in the stored procedure.
   
    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/10.png" width="600" >}}

4. Click **Run Query**. This returns an entity with the number of affected rows and all INOUT and OUT parameters. If the stored procedure returns a **Result set**, an associated entity is created.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/11.png" width="600"  >}}

5. Click **Use Response** > **Save Query & Create Entity** to save the query and the newly-created entities in the domain model.

{{% alert color="info" %}}DML commands within a stored procedure are rolled back if they are not committed by a stored procedure, but DDL commands are not.{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}} Only stored procedures with primitive datatype parameters are supported.{{% /alert %}}

For Postgres, Mendix supports the following parameters:

* Decimal/numeric
* Real
* Double Precision
* Big Serial
* Small Serial
* Serial
* Bpchar
* Char
* Varchar
* Text
* Integer
* Smallint
* Bigint
* Timestamp with timezone
* Date only
* Time without timezone
* Time with timezone

For MSSQL, for **INOUT** and **OUT** parameters of type Decimal, test values (in design time) are rounded off. 

## Use the Query External Database Activity

1. Add the [Query external database](/refguide/query-external-database/) activity into your microflow.

2. Double-click on the activity and select the new external database document.

3. In the **Query** field, select the required query from the drop-down.

4. Assign values to the parameters using the **Expression editor**.

5. Output details for the selected query auto-populate.

You are now ready to use data from an external database in your Mendix App.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Make sure to use secure measures, as this action can allow for SQL injection into your app. Do not use user-supplied or environment-supplied variables in your SQL statement; if possible, they should be static.
