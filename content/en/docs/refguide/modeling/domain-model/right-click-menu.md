## Introduction

The right-click menu in the domain model allows you to manage an entity, as well as its attributes and associations. For example, you can use the menus to review properties, find usages within your app, and generating overview pages based on an entity's data.

## Entity Menu Overview

The entity right-click menu items are described in the table below.

| Menu item        | Description                     | Shortcut key |
