## Introduction

Use view entities to show data across multiple associated entities. 

## Use Case

For this purpose of this use case, the following domain model is used:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/create-overview-pages/domain-model.png" >}}

In this scenario, you will create an overview page that lists each product in a [data grid]( /appstore/modules/data-grid-2/), including information about its category and supplier. With view entities, you do not have to manage associations when showing the data in a data grid. This means that all fields are filterable and sortable, which allows for higher performance and flexibility.

{{% alert color="info" %}}

You must have an existing database containing data prior to using a view entity. Do this by generating overview pages using the entities in the above domain model, then adding sample data. 

{{% /alert %}}

## Create a Data Grid 

Create a view entity that combines only the relevant attributes of the entities *Product*, *Supplier*, and *Category*. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open your domain model and add a new view entity.
2. Name the view entity *ProductOverviewVE*.
3. Add the following query to the OQL editor: 

    ```sql
    SELECT
      p.ProductId as ProductId,
      p.ProductName as ProductName,
      p.QuantityPerUnit as QuantityPerUnit,
      p.Discontinued as Discontinued,
      s.CompanyName as Supplier, 
      c.CategoryName as Category
    FROM Shop.Product as p
      JOIN p/Shop.Product_Supplier/Shop.Supplier as s
      JOIN p/Shop.Product_Category/Shop.Category as c
    ```

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This query uses OQL to take the four attributes of each product and combines them with the associated supplier and category. If there is no supplier or category, the product will not be included. For more information, see [OQL Expressions](/refguide/oql-expressions/).

{{% /alert %}}

4. Click **OK**. The view entity is added to your domain model.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/create-overview-pages/product-overview-ve.png" width="150" >}}

5. Generate an overview page by right-clicking the view entity > **Generate overview pages**.
   
6. Add the new overview page to the navigation.

7. Run your app locally, then click **View App**. You should see the data grid populated with the information that was previously added.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/create-overview-pages/live-data-grid.png"  >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}

In the new data grid created by *ProductOverviewVE*, the **Edit** button is not functional. You can hide or remove this button, or use it to [add a new product](#add-product) to the grid.

{{% /alert %}}

## Alternative to Calculated Attributes

You can use view entities to search and sort items, as well as hold the calculated attribute (or Total Value). This is only calculated once, unlike a non-persistable entity, where it is calculated each time the object is accessed. 

For example, the *OrderLine* entity represents a single entry in an order. It has the following attributes:

* `UnitPrice`
* `Quantity`
* `Discount`

### Get Total Value

Suppose you want to get the total value of each order line, which is given by the formula `Total = UnitPrice * Quantity * (1 – Discount)`. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Create a view entity and name it *OrderLineWithTotalVE*.
2. Add the following query to the OQL editor:

    ```sql
    SELECT
      ol.OrderLineId as OrderLineId,
      ol.Quantity as Quantity,
      ol.UnitPrice as UnitPrice,
      ol.Discount as Discount,
      (ol.Quantity * ol.UnitPrice * (1 - ol.Discount)) as Total
    FROM Shop.OrderLine ol
    ```

3. Generate an overview page by right-clicking the view entity > **Generate overview pages**.
4. Add the new overview page to the navigation.
5. Run your app locally, then click **View App**. Use this view entity in a data grid to show the total value.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/create-overview-pages/total-value.png" >}}

### Join OrderLine and Order Entities

You can calculate the total value of an order by joining the `OrderLine` and `Order`tables. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new view entity and name it *OrderWithTotalValueVE*.
2. Add the following query to the OQL editor: 

    ```sql
    SELECT
      o.OrderId as OrderId,
      o.OrderDate as OrderDate,
      o.RequiredDate as RequiredDate,
      o.ShippedDate as ShippedDate,
      SUM(ol.UnitPrice * ol.Quantity * (1 - ol.Discount)) as TotalOrderValue,
      SUM(ol.Quantity) as TotalProductCount,
      COUNT(*) as UniqueProductCount
    FROM Shop."Order" as o
      JOIN o/Shop.OrderLine_Order/Shop.OrderLine as ol
    GROUP BY o.OrderId, o.OrderDate, o.RequiredDate, o.ShippedDate
    ```
 
This results in a view entity that shows the total value of every order.  

{{% alert color="info" %}} 
Notice the quotation marks in `Shop.”Order”`. This is because `Order` is a reserved keyword in OQL. To avoid ambiguity, quotation marks are put around the word. 
{{% /alert %}}

3. Generate an overview page by right-clicking the view entity > **Generate overview pages**.
4. Add the new overview page to the navigation.
5. Run your app locally, then click **View App**. This results in a view entity that shows the total value of every order.

## Update Underlying Persistent Entities

On the Product overview page above, there is no button to add or modify a product. This functionality can be added to a view entity to update its corresponding persistable entity object.

1. Create a microflow and name it *ACT_UpdateProduct*. 
2. Add a parameter and in the entity field and select **ProductOverviewVE**.
3. Add a [retrieve](/refguide/retrieve/) activity. In this activity, retrieve a *Product* object from the database. Configure the activity with the following details: 

    * Use the following XPath constraint:

        ```
        [(ProductId = $ProductOverviewVE/ProductId)]
        ```

    * In the Options field, set Range to **First** 
  
4. Add a [Change Object]( /refguide/change-object/) activity. Configure the activity by adding the attributes of `Product` to reflect those of `ProductOverviewVE` 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/create-overview-pages/change-object.png" >}}

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/create-overview-pages/product-overview-microflow.png" >}}
  
5. Open the ProductOverviewVE_NewEdit page that was generated by *ProductOverviewVE*.
6. Remove the Product ID, Supplier, and Category fields.
7. Double-click the **Save** button and in the **On click** field, select **Call a microflow**.
8. Under Microflow, click **Select** > **ACT_UpdateProduct**. 
9. Click **OK**.
10. Open the ProductOverviewVE_Overview page.
11. Add a button to the grid and link it to the ProductOverviewVE_NewEdit page. 

Once these steps are complete, run your app locally and test the functionality.

## Update Associated Product Category and Supplier

Add the capability to update a product’s associated category and supplier. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open your domain model and double-click **ProductOverviewVE**.
2. Add `CategoryId` and `SupplierId` by using the following query in the OQL editor:

    ```sql
    SELECT
      p.ProductId as ProductId,
      p.ProductName as ProductName,
      p.QuantityPerUnit as QuantityPerUnit,
      p.Discontinued as Discontinued,
      s.CompanyName as Supplier,
      c.CategoryName as Category,
      s.SupplierId as SupplierId,
      c.CategoryId as CategoryId
    FROM Shop.Product as p
      JOIN p/Shop.Product_Supplier/Shop.Supplier as s
      JOIN p/Shop.Product_Category/Shop.Category as c
    ```

3. Create two more view entities that retrieve ID and names from the Supplier and Category tables and name them *SupplierNamesVE* and *CategoryNamesVE*. Add the following queries into the OQL editor. Add one to each entity:

    ```sql
    SELECT
      s.SupplierId as SupplierId,
      s.CompanyName as SupplierName
    FROM Shop.Supplier s
    ```

    ```sql
    SELECT
      c.CategoryId as CategoryId,
      c.CategoryName as CategoryName
    FROM Shop.Category c
    ```

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/create-overview-pages/supplier-and-category-ve.png" width="400" >}}

4. On the ProductOverviewVE_NewEdit page, add a combo box inside the data view. Include the following information:

    * In the **Data source** field, select **Database**
    * Under **Selectable objects**, click **Edit** > **Entity (path)** > **CategoryNamesVE** > **Select**
    * Under **Caption**, select **CategoryNames**
    * Under **Value**, select **CategoryId**
    * Under **Target attribute**, select **Category**

5. Add another combo box and repeat the above steps for the *SupplierNameVE* entity. 

The final data view should look like this:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/create-overview-pages/product-overview-page.png" >}}

## Update Product Microflow {#update-microflow}

Once the Product page is complete, update the related microflow. To do this, follow the steps below: 

1. Open the **ACT_UpdateProduct** microflow.
2. Add a Retrieve activity after the existing Retrieve product activity. 
3. Retrieve a Category object from the database. Configure the activity using the following details:
   
    * Use the following XPath constraint: 
    
        ```
        [CategoryId = $ProductOverviewVE/CategoryId]
        ```

    * In the Range field, select **First** 

4. Add another Retrieve activity to retrieve the Supplier object. Configure the activity using the following details: 

    * Use the following XPath constraint: 

        ```
        [SupplierId = $ProductOverviewVE/SupplierId]
        ```

    * In the Range field, select **First** 
  
5. In the existing Change Product activity, click **New** and add the Category and Supplier associations and set them to their corresponding objects. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/create-overview-pages//update-product-microflow.png" >}}

When you run your app, you should now be able to update the product’s category and supplier. 

## Add a New Product {#add-product}

You can use a view entity to add a new product into the existing database. Follow the steps below:

1. Create a new microflow and name it *ACT_CreateProduct*
2. Add a Create object activity to create a *Product* (the persistable entity) object. Leave all the attributes blank.
3. Check the Commit checkbox.
4. Place another Retrieve object activity after the previous activity. 
5. Retrieve `ProductOverviewVE` that corresponds to the new `Product` object. Configure it with the following details:

    * Use the following XPath constraint: 
    
        ```
        [(ProductId = $NewProduct/ProductId)] 
        ```

    * In the Range field, select **First**

6. Add a Show page activity and set it to open the Edit Product page. Use `NewProductVE` as the page parameter. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/create-overview-pages/create-product-microflow.png" >}}

7. Open the ProductOverviewVE_Overview page and add a new button named *New*.
8. In the new button, under **On click**, select **CreateProduct**.
