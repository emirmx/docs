## Introduction

The **Help us improve** popup allows users to provide feedback on their experience with Studio Pro. This feedback is valuable for the Mendix team to understand user needs and improve the product.

The popup opens periodically for users to provide feedback. Users can rate their experience on a scale of -2 to 2, with -2 being the lowest score and 2 being the highest score.

To disable the popup from opening periodically, go to the **Preference** > **Advanced** > **Feedback Survey** > **Show feedback survey periodically** and select the **No** option:

### Send Feedback

The **Send Feedback** button is disabled until a score is selected. Once a score is specified, the button is enabled, allowing users to send their feedback. Additionally, users can provide a justification for their score, but this is optional.
