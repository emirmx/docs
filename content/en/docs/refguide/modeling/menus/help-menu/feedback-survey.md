## Introduction

The **Help us improve** dialog box allows you to provide feedback on your experience with Studio Pro. This feedback is valuable for the Mendix team to understand user needs and improve the product.

The **Send Feedback** button is disabled until a score is selected. Once a score is specified, the button is enabled, allowing you to send your feedback. You can provide justification for your score, but this is optional.

## Feedback Survey Overview

The **Help us improve** dialog box opens periodically for you to provide feedback. You can rate your experience on a scale from -2 to 2, with -2 being the lowest score and 2 being the highest score.

### Disabling the Feedback Survey

To disable the dialog box from opening, open the **Edit** menu and click **Preferences** > **Advanced** > **Feedback Survey** > **Show feedback survey periodically** and select **No**:
