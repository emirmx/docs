## Introduction

Use the **History** pane to see the changes that have been committed to a development line of an app. You can open this pane from the **Version Control** > **History…** menu item. The **History** pane displays all revisions at once in a searchable grid, making it easy to view the detailed project history.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In Studio Pro 11.6, a new default view for History was introduced. Partially-cloned apps automatically get the older blocking dialog and through the [Version Control Preferences](/refguide/preferences-dialog/#history-pane), you can choose to keep using the blocking dialog for all apps.

When using the Revision Selector to select a revision to revert, to merge from, create a branch line off, or to create a deployment archive from, the blocking dialog is still used.

For more information on the blocking dialog, refer to the [Mendix 10 documentation](/refguide10/history-dialog/).

## Revisions

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/menus/version-control-menu/history-dialog/revisions.png" alt="Revisions Image" class="no-border" >}}

Each line in the grid represents a revision in the repository. 

### Search and Filters

There are different filter options available to help find specific revisions:

* The search bar looks in all fields of the revisions grid and in the details of the commit, such as the Model changes, Disk changes and Stories.
* The date filter allows specifying a date range for revisions. The available presets help to quickly select a range.
* The document filter allows selecting a document, such as a specific microflow, to filter all revisions on.

### Content

For each revision the following information is shown, more information about each of these values is available below:

* [Revision](#revision)
* [Status](#status)
* [Changes](#changes)
* [Author](#author)
* [Date/Time](#datetime)
* [Message](#message)

By selecting a revision in this grid, the tabs below the grid will be filled with information about this revision.

#### Revision{#revision}

A unique alphanumeric identifier of the revision in the repository. The revision identifier is the Git hash for the commit and is unique for a whole repository.

#### Status{#status}

Shows the state of the revision in relation to the server. It can have one of the following values:

* **Synced** – shown when revision exists locally as well as on the server
* **Local** – shown when the revision is only available locally, because a local commit was made
* **On server** – shown when the revision is only available on the server; this is an indicator there is incoming work that will have to be merged before being able to push new commits to the server

#### Author{#author}

The person who committed the change.

#### Date/Time{#datetime}

The date the revision was created.

#### Message{#message}

The message saved with the commit. If the message is long, you can read it more easily in the **Message** tab page by selecting the revision.

## Details of Revisions

On the right of the grid are a number of tabs which give further details about the currently-selected revision.

### Message

This tab shows the message saved when these changes were committed.

The **Mendix version** that was used to commit the revision to the model is also shown. 

### Model Changes

This tab shows a list of documents that were changed in the selected revision. From here you can jump to the currently selected changed document by clicking **Go to**, assuming the document still exists in the current version.

The search bar within the tab can be used to filter the list of documents.

### Disk Changes

This tab shows a list of the files that were changed on disk. You can see whether files were added, deleted or modified.

The search bar within the tab can be used to filter the list of files.

### Stories

This tab shows a list of stories that are related to the changes.
