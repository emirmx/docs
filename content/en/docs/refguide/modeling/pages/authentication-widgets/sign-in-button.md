The **sign-in button** widget is a Dojo widget.

This widget is not supported in the [React client](/refguide/mendix-client/react/).

This widget is not supported on native mobile pages.

Upgrade it to the normal input and action widgets as shown in the Atlas login page template. See the Mendix React Client's [Migration Guide](/refguide/mendix-client/react/#sign-in-widgets) for more information.

If you [switch to the React client](/refguide/app-settings/#react-client), the widget will not appear in the **Toolbox**.

The Dojo client is deprecated and will be removed in Mendix 12. It continues receiving security and stability updates until the end of support of Mendix 11.24.

## Introduction

The **Sign-in button** sends a user's login ID and password to the server for authentication:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/pages/authentication-widgets/sign-in-button/sign-in-button.png" alt="Sign-In Button" class="no-border" >}}

Any errors are displayed in a [validation message widget](#validation-message-widget) or in a pop-up window. 

The **Sign-in button** should be placed on a page together with a [Login ID text box](/refguide/login-id-text-box/) and a [Password text box](/refguide/password-text-box/).
