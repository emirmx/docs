## Introduction

% alert color="warning" %}}
Starting October 2025, Mendix 8 will no longer be supported for running native mobile applications. Please upgrade to the most recent [MTS or LTS version](/releasenotes/studio-pro/lts-mts/) of Mendix. Outdated apps may stop functioning as expected on newer OS versions. For more information, please see [this blog post](https://www.mendix.com/blog/empowering-mobile-innovation/).
{{% /alert %}}

As of Mendix 8, it is possible to build fully native mobile apps. Native mobile apps differ from hybrid apps in that they do not render inside a web view. Instead, they use native UI elements. This enables fast performance, smooth animations, swipe gestures, and improved access to all native device capabilities.
