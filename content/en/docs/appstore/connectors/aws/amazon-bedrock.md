## 1 Introduction

The [Amazon Bedrock](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/215042) connector enables you to enrich your Mendix app with generative AI capabilities by connecting it to [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).

### 1.1 Typical Use Cases

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) from Amazon and leading AI startups available through an API, so you can choose from various FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case. With the Amazon Bedrock serverless experience, you can quickly get started, easily experiment with FMs, and seamlessly integrate and deploy them into your applications using AWS tools and capabilities. Typical use cases include the following:

* Building an AI agent to answer questions about proprietary data.
* Generating images based on text prompts and displaying them in the Mendix app.

### 1.2 Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The Amazon Bedrock connector requires Mendix Studio Pro version 9.18.0 or above.

To authenticate with Amazon Web Service (AWS), you must also install and configure the [AWS Authentication connector version 3.0.0 or higher](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333). It is crucial for the Amazon Bedrock connector to function correctly. For more information about installing and configuring the AWS Authentication connector, see [AWS Authentication](/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/).

### 1.3 Licensing and Cost

This connector is available as a free download from the Mendix Marketplace, but the AWS service to which is connects may incur a usage cost. For more information, refer to AWS documentation.

The pricing of the Amazon Bedrock Connectors is dependent on the Foundational Model that you use. You can find information about the pricing in the Foundational Model overview in the AWS console.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Most AWS services provide a free tier that allows easy access to most services. To find out if this service is included in the free tier, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). To calculate the potential cost of using an AWS service outside of the free tier, use the [AWS Cost calculator](https://calculator.aws/).
{{% /alert %}}

Depending on your use case, your deployment environment, and the type of app that you want to build, you may also need a license for your Mendix app. For more information, refer to [Licensing Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps-outside-mxcloud/).

## 2 Installation

Follow the instructions in [Using Marketplace Content](/appstore/overview/use-content/) to import the Amazon Bedrock connector into your app.

## 3 Configuration

After you install the connector, you can find it in the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonBedrockConnector** section. The connector provides a [domain model](#domain-model) and several [activities](#activities) that you can use to connect your app to Amazon Bedrock. Each activity can be implemented by using it in a microflow. To ensure that your app can connect to the AWS service, you must also configure AWS authentication for the connector.

### 3.1 Using Amazon Bedrock Models

To use Amazon Bedrock models, keep in mind some specific requirements, as listed below.

#### 3.1.1 Model Lifecycle

Amazon Bedrock models have a lifecycle that consists of the Active, Legacy, and EOL stages. For more information, see [Model lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-lifecycle.html). Models are no longer available for use after they reach the EOL state. To ensure that your application functions as intended, make sure that you regularly monitor the state of the model that you are using. For example, you may want to use an API call to retrieve the status of the model and alert you once it reaches the Legacy state.

#### 3.1.2 Server-Side Validation

Amazon Bedrock has server-side validation for specific models. The Claude models require all prompts to be in the following format:

```text
Human: <PROMPT>
Assistant:
```

For more information, see [Inference parameters for foundation models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters.html).

### 3.2 Configuring AWS Authentication

In order to use the Amazon Bedrock service, you must authenticate with AWS. To do so, you must set up a configuration profile in your Mendix app. After you set up the configuration profile, the connector module handles the authentication internally.

As of version 3.0.0 of the [AWS Authentication Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120333), all the resources and logic required to set up authentication are centralized inside the AWS Authentication Connector module.

The AWS Authentication Connector supports both **static credentials** and **temporary credentials**. For more information and detailed instructions please refer to the [AWS Authentication Connector documentation page](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/connectors/aws/aws-authentication/).

### 3.3 Configuring a Microflow for an AWS Service

After you configure the authentication profile for Amazon Bedrock, you can implement the functions of the connector by using the provided activities in microflows. For example, to list all foundational models, implement the [List Foundation Models](#list-foundation-models) activity by doing the following steps:

1. In the **App Explorer**, right-click on the name of your module, and then click **Add microflow**.
2. Enter a name for your microflow, for example, *ACT_ListFoundationModels*, and then click **OK**.
3. From the **Toolbox**, drag a **Create Object** activity to your microflow and create an object of type `ListFoundationModelsRequest`.
4. In the **App Explorer**, in the **AmazonBedrockConnector** section, find the **ListFoundationModels** activity.
5. Drag the **ListFoundationModels** activity onto the work area of your microflow.
6. Double-click the **ListFoundationModels** activity to configure the required parameters.
7. For the **ENUM_Region** parameter, provide a value by using a variable or an expression. This must be of the type `ENUM_Region` of the AWS Authentication connector.
8. For the **Credentials** parameter, provide a **Credentials** object from the AWS Authentication connector:
    1. In the **App Explorer**, in the **AWSAuthentication** > **Operations** section, find the **GetStaticCredentials** or **GetTemporaryCredentials** action.
    2. Drag the one you would like to use to the beginning of your microflow.
    3. Double-click the microflow action to configure the required parameters and provide a value for the AWS Region. For the **ListFoundationModels** parameter, provide the `ListFoundationModelsRequest` created in step 3.
9. The `ListFoundationModelsResponse` object is returned by the **ListFoundationModels** activity.
10. From the **Toolbox**, drag a **Retrieve** activity to your microflow and place it after the **ListFoundationModels** activity.
11. Double-click the **Retrieve** activity and make sure **By Association** is selected.
12. Select the **FoundationModelSummary_ListFoundationModelsResponse** association, which will return a list of the type [FoundationModelSummary](#foundation-model-summary).
13. To further use the response information, you can create an implementation module with copies of the `ListFoundationModelsResponse` and `ModelSummary` Entities. This way, you can use your custom user roles and access rules for those entities and keep them when updating the connector.

### 3.4 Invoking Specific Models by Using the InvokeGenericModel Operation

To help users understand what needs to be done to invoke a specific model using the [Invoke Model](#invoke-model), we have included two example implementations in the Amazon Bedrock Connector:

* An implementation for invoking the Claude v. 2.1 LLM that generates text
* An implementation for the SDXL v. 1.0 LDM model that generates images from a text prompt.

These examples can be used as a reference together with the documentation found on this page, in the Bedrock console, and offered by the provider of the model. For more Example implementations, see [Amazon Bedrock Example Implementation](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/215751).  

To invoke a specific model, perform the following steps:

1. Choose the model with which you want to interact by using the [Invoke Model](#invoke-model) operation.
2. In the [Model Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters.html) section of the Amazon Bedrock user guide, find the request and response JSON structures of the specific model that you want to invoke.
3. Create your domain model inspired by the JSON structures that you found by using a tool to visualize Json structures, such as [JSON Crack](https://jsoncrack.com/editor).
4. In Mendix Studio Pro, create a JSON structure by doing the following steps:
    1. Right-click on the target folder.
    2. Click **Add other** > **JSON structure**.
    3. Create a structure for the request JSON.
    4. Repeat the previous steps to create a structure for the response JSON.
    5. Open the created JSON structure.
    6. Paste the request or response JSON into the created structure.
    7. Click **OK**.
5. Generate export and import mappings for the request and response JSON structures.
    The export mapping creates a JSON from the request-related objects (specific to the model that you want to invoke). The JSON must be added as the request body of the `InvokeModelRequest` object provided as input parameter to the [Invoke Model](#invoke-model) operation. The import mapping maps the response returned by the [Invoke Model](#invoke-model) operation to your model-specific response objects. To create import or export mappings, perform the following steps:
    1. Right-click the target folder.
    2. Click **Add other** > **Import/Export mapping**.
    3. In the dialogue window, select the **Schema source**.
    4. Click **JSON structure** and select the appropriate request/response JSON structure.
    5. Select the relevant schema elements.
    6. Click **OK**.
    7. Map the relevant elements to the correct attributes by double-clicking the shown entities and choosing the correct entity attributes for the correct elements.
6. Create a microflow that invokes a specific model using the [Invoke Model](#invoke-model) operation, such as in the following figure (for Claude v. 2.1):

    {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/connectors/aws-bedrock/microflow.png" >}}

### 4.2 Activities {#activities}

Activities define the actions that are executed in a microflow or a nanoflow. For more information, see [Activities](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/activities/).

#### 4.2.1 ListFoundationModels {#list-foundation-models}

The `ListFoundationModels` activity allows you to get all the available foundational models which Amazon Bedrock provides. It requires `ENUM_Region`, `Credentials` and `ListFoundationModelsRequest` as input parameters.

The input and output for this service are shown in the table below:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `ENUM_Region (enumeration)`, `Credentials (object)`, `ListFoundationModelsRequest (object)` | `ListFoundationModelsResponse (object)`|

#### 4.2.2 InvokeModel {#invoke-model}

The `InvokeModel` activity allows you to invoke a model from Amazon Bedrock. This activity provides the generic parts that are equal for the invocation of every model. It requires `ENUM_Region`, `Credentials` and `InvokeModelRequest` as input parameters.

The `InvokeModel` operation provides a versatile interface for integrating with Amazon Bedrock models. Each available model in Amazon Bedrock has its own set of model-specific parameters required to be passed into the `InvokeModelRequest`. The Amazon Bedrock Connector contains two example implementations to showcase how to use the `InvokeModel` operation to invoke specific models. The [Amazon Bedrock example implementation](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/215751) available on the Mendix Marketplace provides a more extensive reference implementation of how to configure the model-specific parameters into the generic `InvokeModel` operation.

The input and output for this service are shown in the table below:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |

## 5 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the Amazon Bedrock connector, use the following troubleshooting tips to help you solve them.

### 5.1 Error Code 400 - Bad Request

The service returns the error code *400 - Bad Request*.

#### 5.1.1 Cause

Your AWS organization may not have been granted access to the model which you are trying to invoke.

#### 5.1.2 Solution

To solve this issue, follow these steps:

1. In your Amazon Bedrock environment, navigate to **Model Access** for the region in which you would like to work.
2. If the status of a model is **Available**, enable access to this model for your AWS organization by doing the following steps:
    1. In the top-right corner of the overview, click on **Edit**.
    2. Select the check boxes by the models which you want to access with your credential set.
    3. Click **Save Changes**.

After the status of the models changes to **Access Granted**, you can use it with the Amazon Bedrock connector.

### 5.2 Error code 404 - Resource Not Found

When invoking a model the error code *404 - Resource Not Found* indicates that the targeted resource was not found.

#### 5.2.1 Cause

Possible root causes for this error include the following:

* You do not have access to the model in the specified AWS region.
* The model which you are trying to invoke is deprecated.

#### 5.2.2 Solution

To solve this issue, verify the following:

1. Ensure that you have selected an AWS Region where you have model access. You can see an overview of the models accessible to you in the AWS Management Console, in the [Model Access](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-west-2#/modelaccess) section of your Amazon Bedrock environment.
2. Ensure that the model that you have selected is not deprecated and that the *model-id* is currently available in Amazon Bedrock.

## 6 Appendix

### 6.1 Knowledge Base {#knowledge-base}

In Bedrock, a *knowledge base* denotes a substantial storehouse of data and information. This serves as a foundational resource, enabling the AI system to glean insights and effectively comprehend and respond to natural language queries.

For more information about knowledge bases, see [Knowledge Base](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html) in the Amazon Bedrock documentation.

#### 6.1.1 Creating a Knowledge Base 

Setting up knowledge bases is usually a one-time configuration, which can be done with the AWS Console. In order to get the best results, you should consider whether you want to use one of the chunking strategies available on AWS when creating the knowledge base, or whether you want to pre-process the data beforehand. 

*Chunking* is the practice of breaking large chunks of data into smaller segments. Chunking the data allows the embedding algorithm to process the given data in chunks, thus increasing efficiency. Chunking can also introduce a structure that helps the model understand which data belongs to the same context. You can use the default chunking strategy, or create a custom strategy if there is a specific way in which the model data should be split. 

For example, when building a chatbot that gives restaurant recommendations, you should set up the knowledge base with a list of restaurant reviews. In this case, using the default chunking into 300 tokens might result in chunks containing reviews for different restaurants, which is not optimal. You will likely have better results if each chunk corresponds to reviews for one restaurant, as with that strategy it is less likely that the model will then associate a review with the wrong restaurant. You can achieve the required results by pre-processing the data so that there is one file per restaurant, and using the **No chunking** option when setting up the knowledge base.

For more information about creating the knowledge base, including a list of the available chunking strategies, see [Create a knowledge base](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-create.html). 

#### 6.1.2 Adding Data from Your App

After a knowledge base has been set up, information from your app can be added in a file to the relevant S3 bucket, and then used during subsequent inquiries. Which information is used and how that information is exported depends on the customer's use case and is up to the Mendix developer to implement. For more information, see [Set up your data for ingestion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-setup.html).

Amazon Bedrock only processes the information that existed during the last sync, so the data source must be synchronized whenever a new file is added to your S3 bucket or the existing files are changed. For more information, see [Sync to ingest your data sources into the knowledge base](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-ingest.html). 

The sync can be done from the information page of your knowledge base in the Amazon Bedrock Console, or by using the [StartIngestionJob](#start-ingestion-job) action in the Amazon Bedrock Connector.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
The sync can take up to a few minutes and the calls to your knowledge base during this process cannot be handled accurately. To make sure the sync process has ended, you can use the [GetIngestionJob](#get-ingestion-job) action in the Amazon Bedrock Connector to retrieve the status of the ingestion job, along with other details.
