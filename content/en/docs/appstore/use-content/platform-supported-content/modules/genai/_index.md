### Typical Use Cases

Mendix supports a variety of generative AI tasks by integrating with tools such as Amazon Bedrock or Azure OpenAI. Typical use cases include the following:

* Create conversational UIs for AI-powered chatbots and integrate those UIs into your Mendix applications.
* Connect any model through our GenAI connectors, or by integrating your connector into our GenAI commons interface.
* Connect your data to ground GenAI systems with data from inside your application and the rest of your IT landscape.

### Getting Started

To familiarize yourself with the GenAI capabilities of Mendix, explore the sections below based on your experience level:

#### Familiar with GenAI

If you are already familiar with GenAI and want to start building, refer to [How to Build Smarter Apps Using GenAI](/appstore/modules/genai/using-genai/) guide to start building your first GenAI-powered application and access further supportive resources.

#### New to GenAI

If you are new to GenAI, follow the steps below:

1. Familiarize yourself with the [concepts](/appstore/modules/genai/get-started/) such as prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and function calling (ReAct).
2. Select the right architecture to support your use case. For a full list of possibilities, see the [Architecture and Components](#architecture) section below.
3. Obtain the required credentials for your selected architecture.

The available showcase applications offer implementation inspiration for many of the listed models.

#### Connecting to Other Models

In addition to the models listed above, you can also connect to other models by implementing one of the following options:

* To connect to other [foundation models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-features.html) and implement them in your app, use the [Amazon Bedrock connector](/appstore/modules/aws/amazon-bedrock/).
* To connect to [Snowflake Cortex LLM](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/complete-snowflake-cortex) functions, [configure the Snowflake REST SQL connector for Snowflake Cortex Analyst](/appstore/connectors/snowflake/snowflake-rest-sql/#cortex-analyst).
* To implement your connector compatible with the other components, use the [GenAI Commons](/appstore/modules/genai/commons/) interface.
