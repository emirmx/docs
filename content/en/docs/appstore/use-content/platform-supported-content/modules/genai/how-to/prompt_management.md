## Introduction

This document explains how to integrate the [Prompt Management](/appstore/modules/genai/genai-for-mx/prompt-management/) capabilities of the ConversationalUI module in your smart app. This how-to rebuilds an example that is implemented in the [GenAI Showcase App](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/220475) which makes it an ideal starting point to follow along. You can also use your existing app or start from scratch as described in the [Build a Smart App from a Blank GenAI App](/appstore/modules/genai/how-to/blank-app/) guide.

Through this document, you will:

* Understand how to implement prompt management in your Mendix application.
* Enable AI experts to prompt engineer in your running application.
* Learn how you can send a crafted prompt to an LLM of your choice.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before integrating prompt management into your app, make sure you meet the following requirements:

* An existing app: either an app that you've already built or preferable the [GenAI Showcase App](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/220475). You can also start from scratch using the [Blank GenAI App](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/227934).

* Installation: If not done already, install the [GenAI For Mendix](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/227931) bundle from the Mendix marketplace.

* Access to an LLM of your choice. The connector needs to be compatible with [GenAICommons](/appstore/modules/genai/genai-for-mx/commons/) (such as [MxCloud](/appstore/modules/genai/mx-cloud-genai/MxGenAI-connector/), [OpenAI](/appstore/modules/genai/reference-guide/external-connectors/openai/) or [Amazon Bedrock](/appstore/modules/aws/amazon-bedrock/))

* Basic understanding of GenAI concepts: Review the [Enrich Your Mendix App with GenAI Capabilities](/appstore/modules/genai/) page for foundational knowledge and familiarize yourself with the [concepts](/appstore/modules/genai/using-gen-ai/).

* Basic understanding of Prompt Engineering: Learn about [Prompt Engineering](/appstore/modules/genai/get-started/#prompt-engineering) to use them within the Mendix ecosystem.

## Integrate Prompt Management {#integrate-prompt-management}

Prompt Management is a capability of the ConversationalUI module that is part of the [GenAI For Mendix](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/227931) bundle. It enables users to create and engineer prompts at runtime. The following steps describe how you can add the capabilities to your navigation:

1. 


## Create Context Entity {#context-entity}

## Create your first Prompt {#reate-prompt}

## Connect your Prompt with your App {#connect-prompt-with-app}

## Testing and Troubleshooting {#testing-troubleshooting}
