## Introduction

This how-to describes how to create an extension that adds an item to Studio Pro menu from scratch.

You can download the example in this how-to in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mendix/ExtensionAPI-Samples).

## Creating an Extension Project

1. Open Visual Studio and create a new project using the `C# Class Library` template.
2. Name your project. It recommended to use a format similar to `MyCompany.MyProject.MendixExtension`.
3. Select the `.NET 8.0` Framework.
4. Add `Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI` NuGet package to the project references. Pick the version that does not exceed the Studio Pro version you installed. To do so, perform the following steps:

    1. Include a reference to the Extensions API [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI): 
    2. Add new file named `manifest.json` to your project. 
    3. Add the following code into the file:

        ```json
        { "mx_extensions": [ "<name_of_your_project>.dll" ] }
        ```

    4. For the `manifest.json` file, right-click **Solution Explorer** > **Properties** and change the **Copy to Output Directory** property to **Copy always**.

## Creating a Test Mendix App

Test your extension by creating or using a Mendix app.

1. Create a new Mendix app using a starter template, or use an existing app.
2. In Studio Pro, go to **App** > **Show App Directory in Explorer** to open the app directory.
3. Inside the app directory, create a new folder named `extensions`.
4. Inside the `extensions` folder, create a sub-folder named after your extension (for example, `MyCompany`).
5. Copy the full path of the sub-folder:
   1. Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> and right-click at the same time
   2. Select **Copy as path**.
6. Add the `Post-build event` script below to your extension project:
   1. Go to [Build > Events configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-specify-build-events-csharp?view=vs-2022)
   2. Use this command: `xcopy /y /s /i "$(TargetDir)" "<path_to_folder>"`
7. Build your extension project by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>
8. In Studio Pro, click [Synchronize App Directory](/refguide/app-menu/#synchronize) (or press <kbd>F4</kbd>) to load the latest version of your extension.

## Creating Your First Extension

To add a menu item to Studio Pro, add the following class:

```csharp
using System.ComponentModel.Composition;
using Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.UI.Menu;
using Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.UI.Services;

namespace MyCompany.MyProject.MendixExtension;

[method: ImportingConstructor]
[Export(typeof(MenuExtension))]
public class MyMenuExtension(IMessageBoxService messageBoxService) : MenuExtension
{
    public override IEnumerable<MenuViewModel> GetMenus()
    {
        yield return new MenuViewModel("Say hello", () => messageBoxService.ShowInformation("Hello World!"));
    }
}
```

Build your extension and press <kbd>F4</kbd> in Studio Pro. Menu items are placed under a corresponding menu with the extensions name. For example, if your extension is named *My Extension*, your menu items will be located under the **Extensions** > **My Company** sub-menu.

The Extensibility API provides you with several services you can use and they are injected into your extension classes by using the `ImportingConstructor` attribute.

It is also possible to get notified when your extension has been successfully loaded into Studio Pro and also just before it gets unloaded. It is as simple as subscribing to the `ExtensionLoaded` and `ExtensionUnloading` events.

```csharp
using Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.UI.Events;

namespace MyCompany.MyProject.MendixExtension;

[method: ImportingConstructor]
[Export(typeof(MenuExtension))]
public class MyMenuExtension() : MenuExtension
{
    public MyMenuExtension()
    {
       Subscribe<ExtensionLoaded>(onEvent: () => { MyActionOnLoaded() });
       Subscribe<ExtensionUnloading>(onEvent: () => { MyActionOnUnloading() });
    }
}
```

## Debugging Your Extension

1. Make sure that the current version of the extension code is loaded in Studio Pro.
2. Attach to Studio Pro process in Visual Studio debugger as follows:
   1. On the **Debug** menu, open the **Attach to Process** dialog box  (or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>).
   2. Search for `studiopro.exe` among the processes.
   3. Select the only found process (or the one with correct title, if you have many) and select **Attach**.

3. Add a Breakpoint inside `Action` delegate in `MyMenuExtension.GetMenus()`. It will be hit when you click **Extensions** > **MyCompany** > **Say hello** menu item.

## Adding a NuGet Dependency

You can freely use [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/) from extensions to access reusable .NET libraries. The following one-time additional setup is required:

1. Open your extension project `.csproj` file by right-clicking **Solution Explorer** > **Edit Project File**.
2. Add the following line into the first `<PropertyGroup>`:

    ```xml
        <CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>true</CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>
    ```

Then you can add a NuGet dependency, for example, using the **Manage NuGet Packages** menu.
