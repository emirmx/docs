## Introduction

This how-to describes how to export an extension so you can publish it in the Marketplace or share it directly with other Mendix developers.

## Prerequisites

Before exporting an extension add-on module, ensure the following feature flag is enabled: `--enable-extension-development` 

For more information, see [Get Started with the Extensibility API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/csharp-extensibility-api-11/get-started/).

## Steps

1. In Studio Pro, open the app that contains your development extension.
2. Create a new module with the same name as your extension folder. For example, if your extension folder is named *MyFirstExtension*, your module must also be named *MyFirstExtension*.
3. In the **App Explorer**, navigate to the **Settings** of this module and click the **Export** tab.

4. Set **Module type** to **Add-on module**.
5. In the **Module version** field, enter the version number of the extension.
6. In the **Extension Name** field, select the name of your extension. This must match your module name.

7. Click **OK** to save the settings.
8. In the **App Explorer**, right-click the module and click **Export** to export the extension.

Now you can [publish the extension in the Marketplace](/appstore/submit-content/#adding) or share it with other Mendix developers.
