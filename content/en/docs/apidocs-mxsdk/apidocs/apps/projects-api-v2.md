## Introduction

The Mendix Projects API allows you to create, edit or delete your projects. It also allows you to manage members of those projects and assign project roles, such as Scrum Master.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
If you want to automate the process of assigning the more coarse-grained Mendix Admin role, you can do so by configuring [Single Sign-On (SSO) to the platform (also known as BYOIdP)](/control-center/security/set-up-sso-byoidp/) and enabling the [IdP-managed Mendix Admins](/control-center/security-settings/#idp-managed-mendix-admins) feature.

## Authentication {#authentication}

Authentication for the Projects API uses a personal access token (PAT).

### Generating a PAT {#generate}

For details on how to generate a PAT, see the [Personal Access Tokens](/mendix-profile/user-settings/#pat) section of *User Settings*.

Select the appropriate scopes, depending on the endpoints that need to be invoked. Refer to the [API Reference](#api-reference) for more information on which scopes to use in which endpoints.

Store the generated value somewhere safe so you can use it to authorize your API calls.

### Using the PAT

Each request must contain an `Authorization` header with the value `MxToken {GENERATED_PAT}`. For example:

```http
GET /projects HTTP/1.1
Authorization: MxToken 7LJEâ€¦vk
```
