## Introduction

Antivirus software can sometimes impact the performance of Studio Pro. To mitigate these issues, you can configure antivirus exclusions for Studio Pro. For more information, see the [Antivirus Software](/refguide10/performance-tips/#antivirus-software) section of the *Performance Tips*.

This document describes how to set up Microsoft Defender exclusions to ensure optimal performance.

## Antivirus Exclusion Overview

If you are using Microsoft Defender, it is recommended to add the app folder to the Microsoft Defender exclusions after loading an app:

### Excluding the App Folder

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This operation must be performed with administrator privileges.
{{% /alert %}}

To exclude the app folder, click **Exclude Folder** in the notification.

After completion, a confirmation pop-up appears. If the operation fails, a failure pop-up is displayed instead.

### Disabling the Antivirus Exclusion Notification

Studio Pro displays a notification when an app is loaded, prompting you to exclude the app folder. To disable the notification, follow the steps below:

1. Open the **Edit** menu.
2. Click **Preferences** > **Advanced**.
3. Check **Antivirus exclusion** > **Do not show antivirus exclusion notifications**.
