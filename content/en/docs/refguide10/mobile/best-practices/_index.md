* [Incremental Synchronization](/refguide10/mobile/best-practices/incremental-synchronization/) – Incrementally sync objects from the server to the device based on changed dates.
* [Batch Synchronization](/refguide10/mobile/best-practices/batch-synchronization/) – Spread long synchronizations to multiple actions and present a progress to your users.
* [Compound Object](/refguide10/mobile/best-practices/compound-object/) – Combine multiple objects to improve synchronization performance.
* [Request Object](/refguide10/mobile/best-practices/request-object/) – Capture changes as objects and apply them after synchronization making these changes more secure.
