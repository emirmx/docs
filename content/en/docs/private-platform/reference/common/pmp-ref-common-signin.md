## Introduction

The initial login screen is the same for all users, whether or not they have administrator access rights. The following login methods are available:

* A local user login with a username and password
* Optionally, an SSO login which redirects to an SSO provider

After signing in, all users regardless of their role are initially directed to the **My Apps** page. Users with the administrator role can switch to admin view by clicking the user icon in the top right corner, and then selecting **Switch to Admin Mode**.
