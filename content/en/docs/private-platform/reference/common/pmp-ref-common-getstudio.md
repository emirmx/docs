Not all Studio Pro versions published by Mendix on the [Mendix Marketplace](https://marketplace.mendix.com/) are compatible with Private Mendix Platform. Private Mendix Platform offers predefined compatible versions of Studio Pro, which are tied to supported Runtime versions and reusable components (such as Starter App templates). Company admins can specify which of these supported versions are available the end users of their Private Mendix Platform.
