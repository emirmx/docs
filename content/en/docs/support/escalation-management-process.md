## Introduction

The Mendix Support escalation process ensures that Mendix provides customers and partners with the means to give an issue broader attention. We are committed to delivering high-quality support to all our customers and partners. If you need to escalate a case, our technical team is ready and available to help you quickly bring your issue to closure.

As a customer, if you feel that the ticket is not handled according to your expectations, you can escalate the issue for more visibility. This ensures that a Support manager/leader of the region is copied in the ticket. The manager reviews the ticket and aligns with the relevant internal parties to determine next steps. 

## Reasons to Escalate a Ticket

Our Support Organization does its very best to abide by the objectives stated in the SLA that we give to our customers. Certain tickets might be technically challenging and require further investigation from our R&D teams, and these cases may take longer to resolve than our SLA indicates. If this delay results in a serious impact to your business, we invite our customers to escalate the ticket to increase visibility.

## Escalation Process Overview

These are the steps involved in the escalation process:

1. You open a support ticket.
2. For the purposes of the escalation, you explain the business impact within that ticket.
3. The SLA is breached or you are not satisfied with the level of service you received.
4. You escalate the ticket through one of the methods described in the [How to Escalate a Ticket](#how-to-escalate) section:

     * Via the escalation email address
     * Via the support ticket
     * Via your Customer Success Manager

5. The Mendix support team validates and acknowledges the escalation.
6. The Mendix regional support manager reaches out to you to discuss the details of the ticket.
7. The Mendix support team works towards finding a solution.
8. Once a solution is found and implemented, the escalation is closed.

## When to Initiate an Escalation

For customers and partners who hold a valid support service contract, an escalation may be initiated anytime after the SLA response time. If you have worked through our standard support processes and you are not satisfied with the level or timeliness of service you received, you can escalate accordingly. Additionally, an escalation can be initiated when there is tangible impact to your production environment, or when there is a high risk to the business operations.

These are some examples of reasons to initiate an escalation:

* Management of a major problem, especially where impact to business is high and the problem is taking too long to isolate the cause of the incidents
* A prolonged outage that exceeds or threatens to exceed the SLA or timeframe
* Frequently recurring or multiple related high-priority incidents where the priority is related to business impact and urgency
* Security breaches identified or reported by a customer without a workaround that is mutually agreed upon
* Data loss or risk of potential data loss

## How to Escalate a Ticket {#how-to-escalate}

The entry point into the Mendix escalation process is through your support case. Please note that, for an issue to be escalated, a support case must be created. We do not accept escalations solely based on communications via email. The reason behind this is to get multiple teams involved if need be in a consolidated manner. All communication between the engineer and the case owner from the conception of the case should be documented within the case notes, so all involved teams can view the progression of the issue.

This is the normal process for a support case:

1. Navigate to [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com/).
2. Click **Submit a request**. A new form is opened.
3. From the drop-down list, select the issue type.
4. Fill in the required information, and submit the ticket.

Once the ticket has been submitted, it is assigned to a Support Engineer. Most of the time, the Support Engineer will come to a solution. They sometimes need to discuss the issue with a Technical Support Lead and, if needed, with our second-line team, such as Mendix Studio Pro, Client, Core, or Expert Services.

If the gap between the customer's expectation and the Mendix Platform possibilities cannot be resolved, an escalation is started.

### Via Email

Send an email to escalation@mendix.com and CC your Customer Success Manager. Ensure you add the following details to your email for an effective event-based escalation process:

* Ticket number
* Reason for escalating the case
* Business impact

One of our managers will respond to your message and begin the escalation process.

### Via the Support Ticket

Add a new comment to your support ticket which summarizes the problem description, and provides the business impact for the escalation. Make sure to add ‘escalation@mendix.com’ to the CC field. One of our managers will review the comment, mark the ticket as escalated, and begin the escalation process.

### Via Your Customer Success Manager

You can work with your Customer Success Manager (CSM) to initiate an escalation. When reaching out to them, please be ready to discuss the details of the ticket so far, as well as the impact to your business. Your CSM will relay this information to a support manager who will begin the escalation process.

## What Happens During the Escalation

A member of our leadership team reaches out to you to discuss the details of the escalation, agree on a communication or meeting cadence, and, if necessary, discuss a technical plan of action. Your account team, which can be made up of your Customer Success Manager, Partner Manager and/or Account Executive, is included in this meeting. The assigned Support Leader works as an advocate within Mendix, and ensures that all relevant Mendix team members are actively involved, and that the ticket gets the right level of attention. 

## Criteria Used to Close an Escalation

The purpose of an escalation is to alleviate the impact to our customer's business. Therefore, once a ticket is escalated, we work to resolve the issue or otherwise provide a workaround which allows the customer’s app to function as intended. Once a solution or workaround is provided, the escalation ends.

## Escalating Outages

Before opening an escalation, it is important to check to see if there is currently an ongoing platform outage. Please check the [status page](https://status.mendix.com/) and see if there are any alerts posted. In the case of an outage, you need to subscribe to that ongoing platform outage to receive updates about it. If you choose to escalate during an outage, Mendix Support acknowledges the escalation, confirms it’s a known issue we are actively working on, and then closes or deprioritizes the escalation while keeping the ticket open until the issue is resolved.  Feel free to reach out via phone or a ticket to receive an update on the status of the outage.
