## Prerequisites

Before setting up the connection to Teamcenter X, you must get some information from your Teamcenter representative:

* **OIDC configuration information**

## Configuring the Mendix OIDC Module

To allow users of your Mendix app to log on via Single Sign-On (SSO), you must set up the OIDC module.

1. Install the following dependent modules from the Mendix Marketplace:

    * Community Commons
    * Nanoflow Commons
    * Mx Model Reflection
    * User Commons
    * OIDC Module

2. In Mendix, navigate to **App Users** and assign admin and user roles to their respective equivalents.
3. Set the constant **Encryption.EncryptionKey** with a random 32-character string.
4. Setup Mx Model Reflection and synchronize all module entities and microflows.    
    For more information, see the [Mx Model Reflection documentation](/appstore/modules/oidc/#mxmodelreflection).
Setup SAMAuth registration in the configuration folder of the OIDC module by [setting the following constants](/appstore/modules/oidc/#deploy-time-idps-for-sso-and-api-security-configuration).

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --------- | ----------------|
| **Client Alias** | A custom name for the client. |
| **Client Id** | The ID for the Mendix app registered with SamAuth. |
| **Client Secret** | The secret key for the Mendix app registered with SamAuth. |
| **AutomaticConfigurationURL** | The well-known config URL that provides metadata for the SamAuth configuration.<br>For example, `https://samauth.us-east-1.sws.siemens.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`. |
| **SelectedScope** | The scope for **openid** and **sam_account**.<br>Multiple values can be separated by a space. |

## Configuring the Mendix OIDC Module with your Mendix App
