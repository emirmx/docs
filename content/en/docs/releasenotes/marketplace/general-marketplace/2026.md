## January 2026

### January 22, 2026

#### New Features

* We have revamped the Marketplace section of Control Center, and have added a few new features and improvements meant to help you more efficiently manage and govern component approvals:

    * You can now add the company-approved (<text class="badge badge-pill badge-company-approved" style="margin-left:0px"> {{% icon name="checkmark-shield-filled" color="green" %}}COMPANY APPROVED</text>) badge to private Marketplace components as well.
    * We have updated page names in an effort to better convey their purpose: 
    
        * **Public Marketplace** is now **Company-Approved**. For details, refer to [Company-Approved](/control-center/company-approved/).
        * **Private Marketplace** is now **Submitted Requests**. For details, refer to [Submitted Requests](/control-center/submitted-requests/).

    * The **Submitted Requests** page is now split up into three tabs instead of two. The newly added tab is **Approval Settings**, and it includes the approval options that were previously displayed at the top of the **Pending Approvals** tab.
