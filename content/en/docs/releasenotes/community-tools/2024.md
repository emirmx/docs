## June 2024

### June 28, 2024

#### New Features

* We released two AI-powered features in the [Mendix Community](/community-tools/mendix-community/): Maia (Mendix AI Assistance) Summarize and Maia Rewrite:
    * Maia Summarize condenses lengthy discussions for a question into key points, making it easier for you to find solutions to your questions without having to plough through every single answer in the thread.
    * Maia Rewrite is an assisted writing aid integrated within the Mendix Community posting interface, which helps you to ask properly-formatted questions that are more likely to be answered.

## February 2024

### February 8, 2024

#### New Features

* Deactivating and resetting your two-factor authentication (2FA) is now self-service. If you want to deactivate your 2FA, you can do this in your Developer Settings; previously, deactivating your 2FA required submitting a Mendix Support ticket. Deactivating your 2FA is the first step if you want to change your 2FA method, phone number, or authenticator app. For more information, see [Changing Your Authentication Method](/developerportal/deploy/two-factor-authentication/#change-2fa-method).

## January 2024

#### Improvements

* We are excited to announce that the Mendix Forum has grown into something much more than just a forum. As a result, we have decided to give it a new name: welcome to the [Mendix Community](/community-tools/mendix-community/)!
