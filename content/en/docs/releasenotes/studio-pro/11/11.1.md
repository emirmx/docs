### New Features
    
- We added a new experimental Java API `Core.createOqlStatement` to execute OQL statements and implemented OQL `DELETE` statements to delete objects in bulk directly in the database without having to instantiate them in the runtime.
- You can now add a query parameter at any request in the Consumed REST Service document through the Query Parameters grid or through the URL editor.

- We now support uploading images and PDF files to your questions for Maia for Domain Model. Additionally PDF upload is now also supported for Maia for Workflows.
- We added support for access keys in context menus for commonly used editors (Domain Model, Microflow, Page, Mapping and Workflow).
- We added a page setting to configure autofocus behavior, giving developers more control over accessibility and user experience. Autofocus is set to "Desktop only" on all existing pages for backwards compatibility, and set to "Off" for new pages.

The available configuration options are as follows:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Off | No autofocus |
| Desktop only | Autofocus is only enabled on desktop devices (computers/laptops) |
| All platforms | Autofocus is enabled on all devices (desktop, mobile, tablets) |
- We added support for getting the url of a stored file using the new client API. You can now use "getFileUrl" from "mx-api/data" to get the url pointing a stored file.
- We are introducing a new core feature in Studio Pro: **Call Hierarchy**. This functionality allows you to visualize both incoming and outgoing calls for documents such as microflows, nanoflows, pages, and more. It helps developers understand how logic flows through the application, for example, what calls a page and what that page calls. This makes it easier to see dependencies, and understand how different parts of the app are connected.

### Improvements
    
- We made a small improvement to the memory consumption of object attributes.
- We've improved the toString implementation of the IMendixObjectMember Java API to include useful data, such as name and value.
- In the logic editors, when expanding loops after inserting elements into them, connected objects are now also moved aside.
- We have defined a list of associations: `System.WorkflowActivityRecord_Actor`, `System.WorkflowActivityRecord_TaskAssignedUsers`, and `System.WorkflowActivityRecord_TaskTargetedUsers`. Non-persistable objects referencing the current user through any of these associations will no longer be prevented from being garbage collected.
- We are happy to announce General Availability of Chinese, Korean and Japanese languages for the UI of Studio Pro. Please refer to [documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/preferences-dialog/#language) for more information.
- When updating pluggable widgets, Studio Pro will now try to preserve the value of properties that change type between versions. This is done when [the property types are compatible](https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-property-types/#converting-properties).
- We improved the notification system to also alert users of third-party antivirus software (beyond Microsoft Defender) that using antivirus may impact system performance.
- We improved the order of the items in the 'Go To' dialog in Studio Pro when searching, to make more relevant items appear higher in the list. (Ticket 221215)
- We improved the quality of Korean and Chinese translations for error, warning and deprecation messages
- We improved the warning message that Studio Pro shows when running an OQL query in view entities. When a query refers to '[%CurrentUser%]' and project security is not turned off, the warning message disappears as soon as the user is specified.
- We improved published REST services in Studio Pro. You can now download OpenAPI files even when unrelated parts of the app are inconsistent.
- We improved the logging of published OData services. The Debug and Trace level of the ConnectionBus_Retrieve log node now log XPaths of requests.
- In the logic editors, when resizing an element, connected annotations are now moved the same way as other elements.
- We removed the legacy Toolbox in favor of the modernized Toolbox.
- Page, snippet, and action variables are now automatically mapped to microflow and nanoflow parameters that share the same name.
- We enabled persistent mode for storing file data in Offline PWA's. This enables larger storage quota's (browser dependent) and the data will not be evicted in case of low disk space or if the Offline PWA is not regularly used. In some browsers this may lead to a browser popup asking for permission.
- We fixed an issue when there are some files left after aborting merge/cherry-pick/Revert a commit. That caused an ERROR in STP. now the files are reset to the initial state after Abort of any of the mentioned operations.
- We now remove web service user sessions if they are expired.

* We upgraded the JDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server to version 12.10.1.
    * If you connect to SQL Server using integrated security in a module such as [Database Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/2888), you may need to update the JDBC driver in `userlib` as well.

- When committing a list of objects, we now use JDBC batch updates to update associations instead of using separate JDBC calls. (This was already the case for attribute updates.)
- We've enhanced the version control portfix functionality by integrating the Git CLI to perform this operation. This update optimizes the process and improves the overall stability of the portfix functionality.
- We removed the old Show Changes On Disk dialogue, as changes to files on disk are now shown in the regular Changes pane.
- Buttons to Choose branch line and Open in Studio Pro are now always visible in the Open App window
- We improved the way Start With Maia handles errors when test data is generated, in particular that they are processed more gracefully and lead to less unnecessary crashes.
- We now allow the `session` and `parser` API's from `mx-api` to be used in plugable widgets as well. They can be imported from `mendix/session` and `mendix/parser` with your widget code.
- We added the `formatValue` and `parseValue` methods from the legacy `mx.parser` API to the new client API.
- We updated the bundled Node.js from v20 to v22.

- We have improved the "On Change" action of the Tab Container widget: no attribute is required and the action is triggered whenever the tab is changed. The caption for the attribute setting is changed from "Attribute" to "Active tab index".
- In the logic editors, we now include Change Object actions when finding Entity usages. (Ticket 249539)
- We improved the External Database Connector so you can dynamically modify connection settings at runtime by configuring connection parameters in the Query External Database microflow activity.

### Fixes

* We fixed a known issue where ___
- Fixed an issue when locally re-running with runtime-only changes while using the React client. They are now properly loaded by the runtime.
* We fixed a known issue where ___
- Fixed an issue where the debugger would not reconnect when restarting an app when using the React client.

- We fixed an issue where trying to retrieve more than 500 external objects by ID at once would fail. For example, when retrieving many external objects by association. (Ticket 251911)
- We fixed an issue with MxBuild that reported successful build before the build process has finished.  (Ticket #252729)
- We fixed an issue in offline synchronization that could result in error log statements and System.SynchronizationError objects containing a text like "Changing member failed for security reasons. No write access for changed member" which was caused by the offline client trying to synchronize a change for a member that was inaccessible by that user.
- We save a file name when saving a document while being offline.
- We fixed a Native only issue that causes synchronize action to prompt error on specific scenarios. (Ticket 250114)
- We fixed an issue in offline apps that could result in significant longer synchronization times when large data sets are synchronized with a lot of associations.
- Fixed an error in native offline apps which causes upgrade from Mendix 10.12 or earlier to cause error.
- We fixed an issue in offline apps where the use of offline entities in XPath constraints of online entities (and the use of online entities in XPath constraints of offline entities) was not properly prohibited.
- We fixed an issue in online entities used in offline apps where associations from online entities to offline entities could result into errors while saving data and calling microflows (errors like 
`java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "GUID:[...]"`).
- We have fixed a caching issue for React applications that have precaching enabled. (Ticket 250116)
- We fixed an issue in which an unconfigured input widget displayed two separate consistency errors pointing to the same problem.

- We fixed an issue where closing a page from a microflow could still trigger data source retrievals on that page. (Ticket 239900) 

- We fixed an issue where in some scenarios, the import of a module containing widgets would overwrite the widgets in the project without checking the version.
- We fixed an issue where during module import the widget version check was incorrectly comparing different widgets. (Ticket 252131)
- We fixed a recurring Oops dialog being caused by showing conditional hidden properties when configuring pluggable widgets through the properties pane, such as data grid 2 columns. (Tickets 254074, 254426, 254632, 254637)
- We fixed displaying parenthesis for excluded documents in App Explorer.
- We added the ability to remove Mendix Studio Pro versions directly from the Version Selector interface when traditional uninstallation fails due to corrupted Windows registry paths, providing users with a manual cleanup option.
- Fixed an issue in the App Selector where users encountered crashes and error messages while trying to "Choose Branch Line" of an app after switching between different user accounts.
- We fixed the issue that the runtime loglevels were not restored correctly when restarting the app from Studio Pro, in case the runtime was stopped earlier due to the trial version timeout. (Ticket 251399)
- We fixed an issue for Import Mappings and Export Mappings that caused checkboxes in the 'Select schema elements' tree structure to be set incorrectly. This will fix Zendesk tickets 251136, 250682, 227036, and 250266.
- We now correctly render the warning message for the assocation storage in the association properties dialog. This was not word-wrapped which caused part of the text to be unreadable.
- We fixed an issue in consumed OData services where clients reading large amounts of data would lead to errors related to database connections (Ticket 251379).
- We fixed an issue in the Call External Action activity which caused a consistency warning about variables not being used even when they were used in an argument expression.
- We fixed an issue in the consistency checks of published OData services. The insertable, updatable and deletable capabilities now have a consistency check that requires choosing a microflow when the user chooses *Call a microflow*.
- We fixed an issue in the *Call REST Service* activity in Studio Pro where, the first time you edited the activity, Studio Pro did not save the body text.
- We fixed an issue in published REST services in Studio Pro where starting the app would move the Edit button of the location towards the left side of the screen. Now it stays on the right side of the screeen.
- In the logic editors, we now correctly update the toolbox when exposed Java action or JavaScript action info changes
- We fixed an issue in the logic editors, where the caption from the Show Message activity did not update when switching between languages. (Tickets 247962, 250137)

- We fixed an issue where Studio Pro on MacOS could crash if the Java Development Kit was not installed.
- We fixed an issue where UTC is used instead of default timezone configured in application settings when executing task queue tasks.
- We fixed an issue where uploading a SVG image would cause an error. (Ticket #244585)
