### New Features

- We added support for PDF document upload in Maia for Workflows, allowing you to generate workflows based on PDF documents in addition to text and image inputs.
- The Changes pane will now automatically be updated if files on disk are changed outside Studio Pro.
- We added support for saving files using the new Client API by calling `saveFile` from `mx-api/data`. For more information, refer to the [Client API documentation](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/client-api/).

### Improvements

- The macOS distribution now includes the command line tools (mxbuild, mx, mxutil), conveniently accessible via symlinks in /usr/local/bin.
- We removed the consistency error for query parameters used in a microflow activity when "Included" property is set to "No".
- We fixed the double scrollbar and button text wrapping in the toolbox when the toolbox is resized to a small width.
- In the logic editors, we added a tooltip to the Tile/List switcher in the Toolbox
- We improved the consumed REST service editor in Studio Pro so that the headers of the parameter grids are always visible.
- We changed the behavior of refresh parameters in Send Rest microflow activity where now we don't add invalid parameters.
- When tracing is enabled, the maximum depth of microflow calls and the maximum number of loops that are reported can be configured using the `mendix.tracing.max.microflow.depth` and `mendix.tracing.max.loop.iteration` JVM properties. The default value of these properties are `10`. The microflow call depth is calculated per runtime node and does not take into account calls made into other Mendix runtimes through REST/WebServices calls.
- We have improved the authentication mechanism in STP. It will fix the below mentioned support issues. 
  - SOLP-3189: Studio Pro on macOS asks the user credentials to get access to Keychain(Passwords) for TeamServer project
  - SOLP-2990: Sign in dialog displayed when committing a change in Studio Pro which was already open
  - SOLP-3244: PMP git issue - wrong credentials fetched from windows credentials store
- We fixed an issue when there were no conflciting changes users were not properly informed and metadata was missing due to cherry pick.

### Fixes

- Add refresh functionality for Marketplace when session times out. The reload button will properly handle the event, by closing the details page and refreshing the search tab view.
- We fixed an issue where a view entity loaded without entity access would throw an exception if used in a location that requires entity access.
- We fixed an issue where an OQL get request with something that was not a SELECT would return results instead of throwing an error.

- We fixed an issue in OQL where declaring an alias for a table in an outer query and using that alias in a union in a subquery would result in an exception that the alias could not be found.
- We fixed an issue in offline synchronization (using the 'Synchronize unsynchronized objects' and 'Synchronize all' actions) that could result in error log statements and System.SynchronizationError objects containing a text Changing member failed for security reasons, no write access for changed member. That was caused by the offline client trying to synchronize a change for a member that was inaccessible by that user.
- We fixed an issue which was preventing updated workflows from being queued for execution when mendix runtime crashes during startup (Ticket 253424)
- We fixed an issue where two different error messages would overlap in the "Choose Branch line" pane after signing in and off.
- We've improved the exception handling of Studio Pro when necessary .NET components are missing with a user-friendly message instead of an oops dialog.
- We fixed an issue in which the Back & Forward Navigation feature wouldn't work with styling-related files (ZenDesk ticket #252248 ).

- Dependencies for the portable version of Studio Pro (WebView2, OpenJDK, and Gradle) are now placed inside the application's installation folder. Installing or removing a specific version of portable Studio Pro no longer affects the dependencies of other installed versions. (Ticket 244240)
- We fixed the issue that when running a Mendix app locally from Studio Pro, some log nodes would not be available in the 'Set Log Levels' dialog. (Tickets 255330, 255510, 255776)
- We fixed an issue where Studo Pro could crash due to an XPath Constraint being too long or complex to parse correctly. Now, a consistency error message is shown instead.
- We fixed an issue in Import Mapping document where values inside folded objects were not correctly parsed to the mapped attribute, resulting in empty values.
- We fixed an issue that prevented line breaks from being inserted in the body editor of POST requests in Consumed REST Service documents.
- We fixed an issue in external OData entity's object initialization where specifying the value(s) for key(s) via microflow expression would fail.
- We fixed an issue where the XPath aggregate function "sum" would not return 0 for an empty result because the name was case-sensitive.
- We fixed an issue where an Enumeration with a value/caption set to `com` would result in a compilation error when you try to run the app. We have also added this to the [reserved words](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide10/enumerations/#name) list. (Ticket 255976)
- We have fixed the issue where importing modules with some files that have long paths and did not compose within path limits failed to throw an error message. It will fix below mentioned support issues.
- 227963: Can't import the Nanoflow Commons to 10.6.x_Maintenance branch line
- 234259: Importing Nanoflow commons impossible
- We fixed an issue where in case of corrupted metadata studio pro was crashing when opening history dialog.
- We fixed an issue where JSON editor in Consumed REST service editor was not loading correctly when in offline mode. (Ticket 244948)
- We fixed an issue when primary (default) buttons had an unreadable text colour.
- We fixed certain items in the View menu being incorrectly ordered.
- We fixed an issue with the Dojo demo user switcher widget where it would not reload the app after switching to a different user, giving the impression that nothing happened.
- We fixed a conversion issue with sorting in the Gallery widget when upgrading the data widgets marketplace module to version 3.0.0 or above.

### Breaking Changes

- Extension authors cannot simply obtain access to `studioPro` object anymore, but have to create it using a function `getStudioProApi`. Extensions API documentation provides more details and examples.

- We now disallow downgrading a Mendix database that had been previously deployed with a newer version of Mendix.
- We have removed the numeric part of IDs in the HTML and added `l` or `p` prefixes for layouts and pages. For example, `89.PCP.MyApps_Overview.snippetCall4` will now be `p.PCP.MyApps_Overview.snippetCall4` instead. The purpose of those numeric parts was to ensure uniqueness of the IDs, however, they are actually not needed here as page and layout already have unique identifiers. Furthermore, their pseudo-random nature meant that rebuilding an application resulted in more changes than needed, limiting the cachability of Mendix applications.
