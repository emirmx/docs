### New Features

- We enabled the OpenAPI **Documentation** pane for Published REST services. Just like when creating a Published OData service, this pane helps you to build the REST service showing a preview of what the resulting OpenAPI document will look like.
- You can now use the **mx tool** to see which private values Studio Pro has stored on you local app data and delete these values.
- We added a CLI command to `mx.exe` to export the **Security Overview** to both JSON and XLSX formats. Use `mx export-security-overview  --export-format [json|xlsx] [--exclude-appstore] [--output-file OUTPUT_FILE_PATH] PROJECT`. The `--export-format` option specifies which export format to use, either `json` or `xlsx`. The optional `--exclude-appstore` flag can be used to exclude Marketplace modules from the export. The `--output-file` option specifies to which file the export should be written. This option can be omitted when exporting to JSON, in which case the output will be printed to the console. The `PROJECT` placeholder should contain the path to the *.mpr* file of the project.
- We introduced a new message for the Maia generation session which allows to either navigate back to the document related to the session or create a new Generate session for the currently active document.
- We added a new menu option **Contact Support** into **Help** > **Support Tools**. It allows users to open the Support website directly from Studio Pro. {TW}
- We enabled the History Navigation arrows by default and moved the navigation settings to the **Work Environment** tab. {TW}
- When opening an existing app in Studio Pro, it now automatically converts to the MPRV2 format.
- MPRv1 apps need to be converted to MPRv2 to be able to commit for *.mpr* files larger than 250MB. By default, conversion to MPRv2 happens automatically.
- We changed **port fix** to **cherry pick** to be more aligned with Git and added recognition of cherry pick and revert operations into the top bar.
- We introduced the OQL Query, a user-friendly interface that represents a view entity and enables users to define and manage OQL queries.
- We introduced a new API for showing modal dialogs from web extensions. It is available under `studioPro.ui.dialogs` in the web extensibility API.
- We introduced a new feature that allows users to add the app folder to the Microsoft Defender exclusions list.
- We introduced a new API for accessing user preferences from web extensions, which retrieves the user's selected theme preference (light or dark) and language settings (e.g.`en-US`). It is available under `studioPro.ui.preferences` in the web extensibility API.
- We introduced a new API for showing notification popups from web extensions. It is available under `studioPro.ui.notifications` in the web extensibility API.

### Improvements


* We made the text in the dialog that is shown when a page could not be found translatable. (Ticket 242035)
* We improved the performance of workflow versioning conflict analysis for workflows with many nested outcome-based activities. (Ticket 242615)
* We upgraded the JDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server to version 12.10.0. If you connect to SQL Server using integrated security in a module such as [Database Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/2888), you may need to update the JDBC driver in `userlib` as well.

- We improved the check/uncheck behavior of the Open API request selection dialog for Consumed REST Service.

* The variables of pages and snippets are now available in XPath constraints.
- In OQL queries you can now use `NULL` in `CAST` expressions when you want to cast an empty value to either `DATETIME`, `DECIMAL`, `INTEGER`, `LONG` or `STRING`. This was already supported in OQL execution in Java actions, but Studio Pro added an error when this was used in view entities or data sets.
- We improved the live preview of view entities in Studio Pro. Columns that represent associations now show the entity name in the header, and when there is no associated object the cell is empty.
- You can now copy from the **Run Query** table in view entities in Studio Pro.
- We improved the layout of the OpenAPI **Documentation** pane. It now features a more compact layout, making it easier to view all the operations your service will publish.
- In the logic editors, we now highlight the loop border when dragging elements inside of it.
- In the logic editors, we made connection points and resize handles only visible on element selected
- We updated `react-native-reanimated` to the latest version. 
- We updated `@react-navigation` to the latest version. 
- `headerTruncatedBackTitle` was deprecated in `@react-navigation` version 7. If the title is too long, `@react-navigation` will handle it. {TW}
- The `mx create-module-package` command now synchronizes and includes the managed dependencies of the module in the exported module package. This allows the module to be used in Studio Pro that has disabled Gradle synchronization. The `exclude-managed-dependencies` flag can be used to disable this behavior.

- The authentication token is now rotated, ensuring a new token is generated upon session expiration to improve security.
- In the **Security Overview** and the modernized entity access rules editor, inherited attributes and associations from an entity's generalization are now marked with a distinct inherited icon.
- Menu is no longer tagged with *aria-hidden* when it is still visible. {TW}
- Menu buttons on menu now reachable when they are visible.  {TW}
- We added *aria-expanded*, *aria-haspopup* and *aria-controls* where relevant. {TW}
- We made it easier to use variables for pages and snippets. The variables are now available in the value selectors of conditional visibility, conditional editability, and text templates.
- The **Connector** pane now features page and snippet variables.

### Fixes

- We fixed an issue where the "Generate validation microflow" feature in the page editor would show an Oops dialog.
- We fixed an issue where Consumed Web Service causing validation failure in runtime for WSDL files imported locally. (Ticket 146066)

- We fixed an issue in Message definitions where custom names were reset on expansion of a node. (Tickets 222597, 227958, 236152, 232930, 240806, 241561, 244349)
- We fixed an issue where an app crash occurs when 'Call a microflow' is selected and select button is clicked in the Map entity dialog. (Ticket 225433)

- We now import only one content-type header from open api contract in Consumed REST Service. (Beta feature)
- We have fixed the behaviour of the `urlEncode` and `urlDecode` functions in the client to align with the runtime. This means that spaces are now correctly encoded as `%20` instead of `+`. `urlDecode` still supports decoding strings containing `+` to ensure backwards compatibility with strings encoded in previous versions (ticket 245510).
- We fixed an issue in the React client where the document title would briefly be 'Mendix' during startup instead of the title configured in the application (ticket 245280).
- We fixed an issue where not all changes were correctly updated in the runtime after a local deployment. For example when adding or removing columns to your datagrid 2 widget.
- We fixed the generation of the JS Docs comments in JavaScript actions for enumeration values.
- We fixed an issue where an Oops dialog was shown when extracting widgets that use an 'unknown' entity type into a snippet.
We fixed an issue where the "Download Latest Version" button in the app selector would download the latest Windows version for MacOS users.
- We fixed an unnecesary redirect when creating a new app from the Mendix Portal.
- We fixed an OOPs dialog that might appear upon clicking a button that accepts changes to it's enabled state (i.e. Enabled -> Disabled).
- We fixed an OOPs dialog that could have appeared after clicking cancel in a progress dialog.
- We fixed F9 view app shortcut. It is used to view the currently running app in the browser. (ticket #243743)
- The command line tools should now support arm64 architectures without the need of installing the dotnet runtime x64.
- We fixed an issue where Studio Pro would crash when collecting support info without a project open.
- We made the context menu that opens in the Page editor or Microflow editor to be capable to navigate via the arrow-buttons.
- We improved the tooltip of the capabilities of business events in the integration pane of Studio Pro

- We fixed an issue where fields that could not be unchecked while Export mapping an XML schema or Consumed Web Service were not checked and expanded by default when selecting the document schema source for the first time. (Ticket 232274)
- We fixed an issue in OQL view entities in Studio Pro, where setting write access to an association would incorrectly result in consistency error CE6593.
- We fixed an issue where Studio Pro would evaluate the type of a COALESCE function expression for numeric arguments to be the type that can contain the types of all provided arguments, which is not in line with the bahaviour at runtime. It now evaluates to be equal to the type of the first argument.
- We fixed an issue in the live preview of view entities, where for very large values Studio Pro would show an incorrect value.
- We fixed an issue in the Published Rest Services where a published REST operation that supports both JSON and XML will now respond with header `Content-Type:application/json` if either the request had `Accept:*/*` header or had  `Accept:application/*`.
- We fixed an issue in the runtime execution of the Send External Object microflow activity, which would log a warning when the remote key mapping had already been stored in the database. It does not log this warning anymore.
- We fixed an issue in the Integration pane where clicking "Show details" on a Business Event search result would display elements from a locally existing version of the service.
- We fixed an issue in published REST and OData services where calling the service using active session authentication with an expired CSRF token in Javascript would cause the browser to show a Username/Password popup (Ticket 243407).

- We fixed an issue in published REST and OData services which would respond with a WWW-Authenticate header for all 401 Not Authorized responses, even when Basic authentication was not enabled for the service.
- In the logic editors, we fixed an issue where multiple identical parameters were generated if a parameter or variable was used more than once by the selection to extract. (Ticket 242517)
- In the logic editors, we fixed the displayed data type for cross-module 1-to-1 associations (Ticket 245052)
- In the logic editors, we no longer truncate variable names.
- In the modernized toolbox, we fixed an issue where the toolbox would not refresh after synchronizing the app directory to load new widgets. (Ticket 237560)
- We fixed an issue in the logic editors where some automatically generated variable names were accidentally translated.
- We fixed an issue where cookies were not cleared before starting new anonymous session.
- When using a related entity predicate in an offline app where the related entity has sub entities, the XPath would not give the results of the sub entities. This has been fixed.
- We fixed an issue (introduced in 10.21) that causes microflow calls to fail in offline apps when there is a non-persistent entity that both associates either the current user or the current session and an yet unsynchronized offline object.
- We removed the Documentation URL field from the properties of a Building Block.
- We improved the generation of Java code for enumerations. 
- We fixed an issue where captions for enumerations did not return the caption in the default language, if no caption was available for the request language code.
- We fixed the checkbox "Show inactive threads (wait/park)" in Runtime Threads window of Studio Pro.
- We fixed an issue where the runtime fails to start with a `NullPointerException` when an invalid disabled activity is present in any microflow.(Ticket 243931)
- We fixed an issue where exporting a module would give a "Unknown dependency synchronization error.". This could occur if the module contained managed dependencies which have both JVM and Android versions, such as Google Guava.
- We fixed a Studio Pro crash which happened when logging a list of strings from a Java action. (Ticket 243124)
- We fixed the date format preview in Studio Pro to be consistent with the actual date formatting behaviour in the runtime and client.
- We fixed an issue where disabling the "Multiple sessions per user" setting incorrectly killed all existing user sessions and deleted all associated tokens, including the currently valid one (Ticket 238657).
- We fixed associations owned by both the parent and child entity not showing up as an association  in the modernized entity access rules editor for the child entity.
- We updated the "Create" entity right icon in the security overview to match the icon used in the modernized entity access rules editor.
- We fixed an issue where the `Substract`, `Union` and `Intersect` list operations did not always return a list with unique values when used in a nanoflow (ticket 240695).
- We reapplied a fix for an issue affecting listening between widgets. (Ticket 206642)
- We fixed an issue where data sources with a default configuration triggered an Oops dialog when hidden by another property.
- We fixed an Oops dialog that occurred when reconfiguring a data source with an invalid expression referring to it.
- We fixed an issue with editing expressions where the expected type was **Not set** when its target was a page or snippet variable. For example static values for Combobox.
- We addressed a performance degradation during deployment involving widgets with text templates. (Ticket 245543)

### Deprecations

- We deprecated the values `true` and `false` for the `com.mendix.storage.PerformDeleteFromStorage` runtime setting. Please use `NoFiles`, `TemporaryFiles` or `AllFiles` instead.
- We deprecated the constructors of the `com.mendix.core.actionmanagement.EventActionInfo` class with a `returnType` parameter. This parameter is not used internally and doesn't give any useful information.
- We deprecated the method `com.mendix.core.actionmanagement.EventActionInfo#representsFunction()`. Use the `function()` method to check whether the `EventActionInfo` instance represents a function.
- We deprecated the method `com.mendix.core.actionmanagement.EventActionInfo#getReturnType()`. There is no replacement as this return type is not used.
- We deprecated the `com.mendix.core.actionmanagement.ActionListener#createClone()` method. This method was meant for internal use only, there is no replacement.
- We deprecated the `com.mendix.core.objectmanagement.member.MendixObjectReferenceSet#setValue(IContext, Set<IMendixIdentifier>, Boolean)` method. This method was meant for internal use only, please use `com.mendix.systemwideinterfaces.core.IMendixObjectMember#setValue(IContext, Object)` instead.
- We deprecated `ActionListener#addReplaceEvent(String)` in Mx11. Please use `ActionListener#setReplaceEvent(String)` instead.

### Breaking Changes


- The default value of the custom runtime setting [DataStorage.OptimizeSecurityColumns](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/custom-settings/#DataStorageOptimizeSecurityColumns) was changed to `true`.

- Following the MariaDB JDBC driver default, if you use MariaDB or MySQL with a `DatabaseJdbcUrl` we no longer accept `jdbc:mysql:` as a protocol. Use `jdbc:mariadb:` instead.
- For MariaDB and MySQL, we no longer set the `sql_mode` driver parameter. Unless overridden in `DatabaseJdbcUrl`, the database default will be used.

- We removed the deprecated Java APIs `Core.retrieveXPath...`. Use the fluent Java API `Core.createXPathQuery` instead.
- We no longer support the JVM parameters `-Djava.security.manager` and `-Djava.security.policy`.
- We removed support for the project setting 'System context tasks'. This setting was deprecated since Mendix 9.6. We now always execute queued tasks in a context equivalent to the one in which they were created.
- We removed the legacy migration of thumbnails. This was introduced around Mendix 6. If you are migrating from a Mendix 6 application then first migrate to Mendix 10 and run the application to finish migration, before migrating further to Mendix 11.
- We removed the type parameter from the `com.mendix.core.actionmanagement.EventActionInfo` class as it only accepts `java.util.function.Consumer` instances with type parameter `IMendixObject`.
- We made the constructors of the `com.mendix.core.actionmanagement.EventActionInfo` class more strict so that it only accepts `java.util.function.Consumer` instances with type parameter `IMendixObject` and a return type of `Class<IMendixObject>`. Passing other types in the past led to unexpected behavior at runtime.
- We removed the deprecated `com.mendix.webui.CustomJavaAction` class. This class was not used anymore.
- We removed the deprecated `com.mendix.core.actionmanagement.ActionListener#clone()`. There is no replacement, this method was only meant for internal use.

- We removed the deprecated `com.mendix.systemwideinterfaces.core.IContext#setExecutionThread(Thread)` method. This method was meant for internal use only, there is no replacement.
- We removed the deprecated `com.mendix.systemwideinterfaces.core.IContext#setExecutionType(ExecutionType)` method. This method was meant for internal use only, there is no replacement.
- We removed the deprecated `com.mendix.core.conf.Configuration#checkConfig()` method. This method was meant for internal use only, there is no replacement.
- We removed the deprecated `com.mendix.m2ee.api.IMxRuntime` interface. Its methods were intended for internal use only. There will be no replacements.
- We removed most of the content of the deprecated `com.mendix.m2ee.api.AdminAction` interface. This interface was intended for internal use only. There will be no replacement.
- We removed most of the content of the deprecated `com.mendix.m2ee.api.AdminException` interface. This interface was intended for internal use only. There will be no replacement.
- We removed most of the content of the deprecated `com.mendix.m2ee.api.IAppContainer` interface. This interface was intended for internal use only. There will be no replacement.
- We removed the result type parameter of the methods `addBeforeEvent(Consumer<IMendixObject>, boolean)` and `addAfterEvent(Consumer<IMendixObject>)` in the `com.mendix.core.actionmanagement.ActionListener` class. This type parameter had no benefits.
- We removed the type parameter from the `com.mendix.core.Core.schedule(String, Date)` method.
- We removed the type parameter from the `com.mendix.core.Core.schedule(ICoreAction, long, TimeUnit)` method.
- We removed the type parameter from the `com.mendix.core.Core.reschedule(RunnableScheduledFuture, ICoreAction, long, TimeUnit)` method.
- We removed the type parameter from the `com.mendix.core.Core.scheduleAtFixedRate(String, Date, long, TimeUnit, String, String)` method.
- We removed the type parameter from the `com.mendix.core.Core.scheduleAtFixedRate(ICoreAction, long, long, TimeUnit)` method.
- We removed the type parameter from the `com.mendix.core.Core.scheduleAtFixedRate(ICoreAction, Date, long, TimeUnit)` method.
- We removed the type parameter from the `com.mendix.core.Core.scheduleWithFixedDelay(ICoreAction, long, long, TimeUnit)` method.
- We changed string concatenation in expressions for empty/null values. Such values are not anymore concatenated as 'null'. The old behavior can be achieved by using an if-else expression (e.g. `'Value: ' + (if $value != empty then $value else 'null')` instead of `'Value: ' + $value`).
- We block starting the app when there are still file documents on the local file system which are created before Mendix 5.12. Make sure all files are migrated before upgrading to this version. Files are migrated automatically in the background when running apps on Mendix versions since 8.14.0.
- We updated the date formatting in the client to be consistent with the runtime in supporting genitive and abbrivated month names. See the table below for the changes between the old and new formatting. The runtime formatting has not changed and is equal to the new client behaviour.

| token | old       | new
|-------|-----------|--------
| MMM   | genitive  | genitive abbrivated
| MMMM  | genitive  | genitive
| LLL   | genitive  | standalone abbrivated
| LLLL  | genitive  | standalone
- We have changed the internal representation in the client of an "empty value" from an empty string to `null`. This fixes an issue where empty string attributes become an empty string value when an object is communicated to the client. Due to this change, both `MxObject#get` and `MxObject#set` have changed to accept/return `null` for empty attributes.
