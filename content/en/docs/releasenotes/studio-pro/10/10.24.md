**Release date: July 22, 2025**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.24.2" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.24.2 from the Marketplace" %}}

### Improvements
    
* We improved the startup performance of task queues. Pending tasks are now validated when they are executed instead of at startup.
* We improved the notification system to also alert users of third-party antivirus software (in addition to Microsoft Defender) that using antivirus software may impact system performance.
* We translated the **Sign In** dialog.
* We improved the quality of Korean and Chinese translations for error, warning, and deprecation messages.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where navigating to a screen already in the navigation history caused unexpected behavior when using the **Side Bar** layout. (Ticket 232247)
* We fixed an issue where closing a page from a microflow triggered data source retrievals on that page. (Ticket 239900)
* We fixed an issue where uploading a SVG image caused an error. (Ticket 244585)
* We fixed an issue where the runtime log levels were not restored correctly when restarting the app from Studio Pro, in cases where the runtime had been stopped earlier due to the trial version timeout. (Ticket 251399)
* We fixed an issue where, during module import, the widget version check was incorrectly comparing different widgets. (Ticket 252131)
* We fixed an issue with MxBuild that reported successful build before the build process had finished.  (Ticket 252729)
* We fixed an issue in the logic editors on macOS where pressing <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> failed to copy the selected activity to clipboard and instead changed its caption. (Ticket 253384)
* We fixed a recurring **Oops** dialog being caused by showing conditional hidden properties when configuring pluggable widgets through the properties pane, such as Data Grid 2 columns. (Tickets 254074, 254426, 254632, 254637)
* In the logic editors, we now correctly update the toolbox when the exposed Java or JavaScript action info changes.
* In the logic editors, we fixed an issue where the sequence flow control points overlapped with the connection points unintentionally in some cases.
* We fixed an issue when there are some files left after aborting a merge, cherry-pick, or revert operation on a commit. That caused an ERROR in STP. Now the files are reset to the initial state after aborting any of the mentioned operations.
* We now save a file name when saving a document offline.
* We fixed an issue with online entities used in offline apps where associations from online entities to offline entities resulted in errors while saving data and calling microflows (errors like 
`java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "GUID:[...]"`).
* We fixed an issue where in some scenarios, the import of a module containing widgets overwrote the widgets in the project without checking the version.
* We fixed an issue in the **App Selector** where users encountered crashes and error messages while trying to **Choose Branch Line** of an app after switching between different user accounts.
* We fixed an issue where `dbms_lob.substr` was unnecessarily applied to limited String attributes when running SQL queries in Oracle.
* We now correctly render the warning message for the association storage in the association properties dialog. This was not word-wrapped, which caused part of the text to be unreadable.
* We fixed an issue with Maia for Pages where it did not properly take the previous API output into account, which could lead to errors during subsequent requests in the same conversation.
* We fixed an issue where selecting **Resolve conflict using server** for a conflicted file did not solve the conflict.
* We fixed an issue with the React client logging a message to the console to download the React Devtools when opening an app locally.
* When upgrading to a data widgets module version 3.0.0 or above, we fixed an issue where the configuration of drop-down filter settings for associations on Data Grid 2 columns was not converted correctly to the drop-down filter widget of the new setup during Data Grid 2 widget updates.
* We resolved an issue that caused the page to crash during navigation when using a Data View widget in the page with nanoflow.(Tickets 252234, 254377, 254487)

### Known Issues

* In the React client, re-running an app locally with runtime-only changes does not properly apply those changes. (Tickets 253176, 253539, 253842, 253932, 254100)
* In the React client, the debugger does not reconnect when restarting an app.

## 10.24.1 {#10241}

**Release date: July 4, 2025**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.24.1" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.24.1 from the Marketplace" %}}

### New Features

* We added support for access keys in context menus for commonly used editors: domain model, microflow, page, mapping, and workflow.

### Improvements

* We improved the order of the items in the **Go To** dialog in Studio Pro when searching, to make more relevant items appear higher in the list. (Ticket 221215)
* In the logic editors, we now include **Change Object** actions when finding entity usages. (Ticket 249539)
* We made the following improvements in the logic editors: 
    * When resizing an element, connected annotations are now moved the same way as other elements.
    * When expanding loops after inserting elements into them, connected objects are now also moved aside.
* We relaxed the restriction that entities with an online synchronization mode could not refer to entities with an offline synchronization mode. It now only prevents XPath constraints in pages and nanoflows that mix entities with online and offline synchronization modes allowing more modeling possibilities.
* We enhanced the version control portfix functionality by integrating the Git CLI to perform this operation. This update optimizes the process and improves the overall stability of the portfix functionality.
* We improved the Java API for implementing CSP in modules. The configuration API was expanded with `getHeader` and `getCustomHeaders` methods for interacting with custom headers and we added a CSP API to the `Core` class that contains the `getTemplate`, `getNonce`, `hasNonce`, and `addHeader` methods.
* We updated the bundled Node.js from v20 to v22.
* We defined a list of associations: `System.WorkflowActivityRecord_Actor`, `System.WorkflowActivityRecord_TaskAssignedUsers`, and `System.WorkflowActivityRecord_TaskTargetedUsers`. Non-persistable objects referencing the current user through any of these associations will no longer be prevented from being garbage collected.
* When upgrading to a data widgets module version 3.0.0 or above, we fixed an issue where grid-wide filtering configuration was not converting correctly to the new setup when filter widgets were wrapped (for example, in a container) during gallery or data grid 2 widget updates.

### Fixes

* In the microflow editor, we now correctly show the Continue error handler on **Call microflow** actions. (Ticket 247917)
* We fixed an issue where trying to auto-commit external entities threw an exception. After this fix, all external entities will be excluded from being auto-committed. (Ticket 250591)
* We fixed an issue for **Import Mappings** and **Export Mappings** that caused checkboxes in the **Select schema elements** tree structure to be set incorrectly. (Tickets 251136, 250682, 227036, 250266)
* We fixed an issue in consumed OData services where clients reading large amounts of data led to errors related to database connections. (Ticket 251379)
* We fixed an issue where an attempt to retrieve more than 500 external objects by ID at once failed. For example, when retrieving many external objects by association. (Ticket 251911)
* We fixed an issue in offline synchronization that could result in error log statements and System.SynchronizationError objects containing a text *Changing member failed for security reasons. No write access for changed member*, which was caused by the offline client trying to synchronize a change for a member that was inaccessible by that user.
* We fixed an issue where Studio Pro on MacOS crashed if the Java Development Kit was not installed.
* We fixed an issue where conflicting versions of userlib jars did not give a consistency warning if the project had no managed dependencies configured.
* We fixed an issue where the tracing service name configuration could not be changed.
* We fixed an issue where some OpenTelemetry configurations did not apply.
* We fixed an issue where HTML anchor and area elements without a *href* attribute interrupted the autofocus behavior, not allowing users to focus to the next item in order.
* We fixed an issue in the React client, where autofocus did not work when navigating to another page.

### Known Issues

* In the React client, re-running an app locally with runtime-only changes does not properly apply those changes. (Tickets 253176, 253539, 253842, 253932, 254100)
* In the React client, the debugger does not reconnect when restarting an app.

## 10.24.0 {#10240}

**Release date: June 26, 2025**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.24.0" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.24.0 from the Marketplace" %}}

### New Features

* We updated the filter button in the **Go to...** dialog to show whether there are active filters.
* In the logic editors, pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> while dragging objects from the **App Explorer**, **Toolbox** or the toolbar will disable snapping the objects to other objects.
* The feature to access online data in offline apps is now generally available. For more information, see [Offline-First Data](/refguide10/mobile/building-efficient-mobile-apps/offlinefirst-data/#intro)
* We changed **port fix** to **cherry pick** to be more aligned with git and added recognition of cherry pick and revert operations into the topbar.
* We enabled native mobile builds for PMP customers.

### Improvements

* We added error logging when a page fails to be loaded in the React client when navigating to it. This can happen when a page includes a widget with a corrupted bundle. (Ticket 245516)
* We integrated the modernized access rules editor into the entity **Properties** pane.
* When updating pluggable widgets, Studio Pro will now try to preserve the values of properties that change type between versions. This is done when [the property types are compatible](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-property-types-10/#converting-properties).
* We made various improvements in the logic editors:
    * We added the option to hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key to display connection points on hover.
    * Making an element smaller automatically repositions its connected elements to preserve the width of the sequence flows between them. 
    * When inserting elements into a flow, connected elements and unconnected elements in the same container are now moved to make space.
* We bundled OpenTelemetry agent jar with Studio Pro. It can be found under `runtime/agents/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar`.
* We provided the  **Enable Tracing** option to enable runtime tracing in Studio Pro. It can be accessed through **App Settings**. For more information, see the [Minimal Configuration](/refguide10/tracing-in-runtime/#min-configuration) section in *Tracing*.
* We no longer close the response writer of custom request handlers, if an asynchronous request is started. With this change it is possible to implement asynchronous request handlers.
* We implemented an OpenTelemetry agent extension that provides default settings. It can be found under `runtime/agents/mendix-opentelemetry-agent-extension.jar`.
* We now add consistency warnings if there are multiple versions of the same Java dependency in your app.
* When importing a module, widget, solution package or when starting a new app from a template, we now prevent the package from unpacking content to undesired directories. The user can still choose to extract the rest of the package.
* We now highlight an access rule that is opened from the **Changes** or **Error** pane in the modernized entity access rules editor instead of directly opening it.
* We improved error reporting for React client. Now you can see JS actions and widgets related errors directly in Studio Pro without having to open application logs.
* We log a warning when starting an app if there are still file documents on the local file system which were created before Mendix 5.12. Make sure all these files are migrated before upgrading your app to Mendix 11, as apps with these files will not start anymore under that version. Files are migrated automatically in the background when running apps on Mendix versions from 8.14.0.
* The Chinese, Korean, and Japanese versions of the Studio Pro UI are now in General Availability. Please see [documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide10/preferences-dialog/#language) for more information.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where hidden pluggable widget properties were not reset correctly. This resulted in translations that caused widget update notifications, missing translations in Data Grid 2, and unused properties creating consistency errors in **File Uploader**. This fix ensures that these properties are reset when hidden with default values, and applied only when they are used. (Tickets 233401, 248682) 
* We fixed an issue where Safari extensions broke the Dojo client. (Ticket 246247)
* We fixed the issue where the size of the offline database was not reduced enough after a sign-out operation. (Ticket 247029)
* We fixed an issue where Studio Pro closed after a user logged in. (Ticket 248086)
* We fixed a caching issue for React applications that had precaching enabled. (Ticket 250116)
* We fixed an issue where enumeration values with the name *Core* caused compilation errors. (Ticket 250532)
* We fixed an issue that native apps upgraded from prior versions to Mendix 10.19-10.23 got an error that prevented the native app to start.
* We have fixed where the **Show** button did not work in dialogs when selecting an entity.
* We fixed an issue in the React client where local reruns hung after making changes to a recursive nanoflow.
* We fixed an issue with using JavaScript actions in a protected module when using the React client.
* We fixed an issue where an [association source](/refguide10/association-source/) in a data grid or template grid stopped displaying data after previously shown data was cleared due to an unavailable context object. (Ticket 250338, 250479)  
* We fixed an issue where the **Mendix Home** button in **Open Global Navigation** redirected you to **My Apps** instead of the home page.
* We fixed the text *Renaming* that was also shown when adding a new document, instead we will display *Checking name*.
* We fixed an error that occurred in the Published OData Service document when changing the documents properties.
* We fixed an issue where Studio Pro closed when adding an SVG file to the **Image Collection** document.
* We fixed an issue in the Consumed REST Service document where an error was displayed after pressing **Send** for specific requests. This issue occurred when receiving empty content for a request that was already connected to an entity before.
* We fixed an issue in the domain model editor where an unexpected exception closed Studio Pro rather than showing the exception in a dialog.
* We fixed an issue in OQL view entities where Studio Pro showed the type of the **AutoNumber** column as **Number**. It now shows it as **Long**.
* In the logic editors, we fixed the following issues:
    * We fixed an issue where an error pop-up window was shown when dragging items from the toolbar into the working area of the editor.
    * We fixed an issue where a parameter was connected to an activity causing Studio Pro to crash.
    * We fixed an issue where the **Change Variable** action could be added through Maia for a variable that could not be changed. For already existing erroneous actions, we now show a consistency error instead of a pop-up window.
    * We fixed an issue that caused incorrect placement of flows and events when adding a **Decision** through the Logic Recommender.
* We fixed an issue in offline apps that caused a query error if access rules restricted access to certain attributes of a generalized entity in an inheritance hierarchy.
* We fixed an issue where microflows tried to use online data in native pages which did not allow for such usage.
* We fixed an issue where converting a nanoflow to a microflow did not trigger a warning when the nanoflow was used in a native page or layout.

### Deprecations

* We deprecated the [Document templates](/refguide10/document-templates/) and the **Generate Document** actions. 
* We deprecated the following methods of the class `com.mendix.core.actionmanagement.internal.InternalCoreAction`: `setContext(IContext)`, `addDatavalidationFeedback(IMendixIdentifier, Map<String, String>)`, `addDataValidationFeedback(DataValidationInfo)`, `handleConcurrentExecution()`, `setEventObjects(List<IMendixObject>)`, `getMetaInfo()`, `setMetaInfo(JSONObject)`, `setActionName(String)`, `getException()`, `setException(Exception)`, `getState()`, `setState(ActionState)`, `setAllowsConcurrentExecution(Boolean)`, `clone()`. There is no replacement as these method were meant for internal usage only.

### Known Issues

* In the React client, re-running an app locally with runtime-only changes does not properly apply those changes. (Tickets 253176, 253539, 253842, 253932, 254100)
* In the React client, the debugger does not reconnect when restarting an app.
