### New Features

- We updated the filter button in the **Go to...** dialog to show whether there are active filters.
- In the logic editors, pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> while dragging objects from the **App Explorer**, **Toolbox** or the toolbar will disable snapping the objects to other objects.
- The feature to access online data in offline apps is now generally available. {TW}
- We changed "port fix" to "cherry pick" to be more aligned with git and added recognition of cherry pick and revert operations into top bar. {TW}
- We enabled native mobile builds for PMP customers.

### Improvements

- We added error logging when a page fails to be loaded in the React client when navigating to it. This can happen when a page includes a widget with a corrupted bundle. (Ticket 245516)
- We integrated the modernized access rules editor into the entity **Properties** pane.
- When updating pluggable widgets, Studio Pro will now try to preserve the values of properties that change type between versions. This is done when [the property types are compatible](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-property-types/#converting-properties). 
- In the logic editors, when making objects smaller, move connected objects so their distances stay the same. {TW}
- In the logic editors, when inserting objects onto a flow, connected objects and unconnected objects in the same container are now moved to make space.
- We bundled OpenTelemetry agent jar with Studio Pro. It can be found under `runtime/agents/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar`.
- We provided the  **Enable Tracing** option to enable runtime tracing in Studio Pro. It can be accessed through **App Settings**. For more information, see the [Minimal Configuration](/refguide10/tracing-in-runtime/#min-configuration) section in *Tracing*.
- We no longer close the response writer of custom request handlers, if an asynchronous request is started. With this change it is possible to implement asynchronous request handlers.
- We implemented an OpenTelemetry agent extension that provides default settings. It can be found under `runtime/agents/mendix-opentelemetry-agent-extension.jar`.
- We now add consistency warnings if there are multiple versions of the same Java dependency in your app.

- When importing a module, widget, solution package or when starting a new app from a template, we now prevent the package from unpacking content to undesired directories. The user can still choose to extract the rest of the package.
- We now highlight an access rule that is opened from the **Changes** or **Error** pane in the modernized entity access rules editor instead of directly opening it.
- We improved error reporting for React client. Now you can see JS actions and widgets related errors directly in Studio Pro without having to open application logs.

### Fixes

- Fixed the case where the size of the offline database was not reduced enough after a sign-out operation (Ticket 247029)
- We fixed an issue that native apps upgraded from prior versions to Mendix 10.19-10.23 got an error during startup that prevents the native app to start.
- We have fixed the 'show' button in selector dialogs not working when selecting an entity.
- We fixed an issue in the React client where local reruns would hang after making changes to a recursive nanoflow.
- We have fixed an issue where Safari extensions could break the Dojo client (ticket 246247).
- We fixed an issue with using JavaScript actions in a protected module when using the React client.

- We fixed an issue where an [association source](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/association-source) on a Data Grid or Template Grid would stop displaying data after previously shown data was cleared due to an unavailable context object. (Ticket 250338, 250479)  
We fixed an issue where the "Mendix Home" button in the 9-dot menu would redirect to "My Apps" instead of the home page.
- We fixed the text "Renaming" that would also show when adding a new document, instead we will display "Checking name".
- We fixed an error that occured in the Published OData Service document when changing the documents properties.
- We fixed an issue where Studio Pro would close when adding an SVG file to the Image Collection document.
- We fixed an issue where Studio Pro would close after a user logged in. (ticket #248086)

- We fixed an issue in the Consumed REST Service document where an error was displayed after pressing Send for specific requests. This issue occured when receiving empty content for a request that was already connected to an entity before.
- We fixed an issue in the domain model editor in Studio Pro, where an unexpected exception would close Studio Pro rather than show the exception in a dialog.
- We fixed an issue in OQL view entities where Studio Pro would show the type of an AutoNumber column as 'Number'. It now shows it as 'Long'.
- We fixed an issue in the logic editors where an oops pop-up window would sometimes be shown when dragging items from the toolbar onto the editor.
- In the logic editors, we fixed an issue where a parameter could be connected to an activity causing the modeler to crash.
- In the logic editors, we fixed a bug where a Change Variable action could be added through Maia for a variable that cannot be changed. For already existing erroneous actions, we now show a consistency error instead of an Oops dialog.
- We fixed an issue in the logic editors that caused incorrect placement of flows and events when adding a decision through the Logic Recommender.
- We fixed an issue in offline apps that caused a query error in case of inheritance with access rules that prevented access to certain attributes of a generalization.
- We fixed the issue that microflows using online data where not possible in Native Pages.
- We fixed an issue where enumeration values with the name 'Core' would cause compilation errors. (Ticket #250532)

- We fixed an issue where converting a nanoflow to a microflow didnâ€™t trigger a warning when the nanoflow was used in a native page or layout.
- We fixed an issue where hidden pluggable widget properties were not reset correctly, resulting in some translations causing widget update notifications and lost translations in Data Grid 2, as well as unused properties creating consistency errors in File Uploader. This fix ensures that these properties are reset when hidden, with default values applied only when they are used. (Tickets 233401, 248682)

### Deprecations

- Document Templates were deprecated in 10.24. For information on migrating to supported methods, see [Document Templates](/refguide/document-templates/).
- We log a warning when starting an app if there are still file documents on the local file system which were created before Mendix 5.12. Make sure all these files are migrated before upgrading your app to Mendix 11, as apps with these files won't start anymore under that version. Files are migrated automatically in the background when running apps on Mendix versions since 8.14.0.
- We deprecated the following methods of the class `com.mendix.core.actionmanagement.internal.InternalCoreAction`: `setContext(IContext)`, `addDatavalidationFeedback(IMendixIdentifier, Map<String, String>)`, `addDataValidationFeedback(DataValidationInfo)`, `handleConcurrentExecution()`, `setEventObjects(List<IMendixObject>)`, `getMetaInfo()`, `setMetaInfo(JSONObject)`, `setActionName(String)`, `getException()`, `setException(Exception)`, `getState()`, `setState(ActionState)`, `setAllowsConcurrentExecution(Boolean)`, `clone()`. There is no replacement as these method were meant for internal usage only.
