## 10.12.13 {#101213}

**Release date: February 3, 2025**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.12.13" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.12.13 from the Marketplace" %}}

### Improvements

* We made the **Commit** dialog box faster and more responsive, which makes it smoother to use.
* We added a logger which logs to a console in JSON format.

### Fixes

* We fixed a Windows-specific issue where temporary files created for images upload were not cleaned up. (Ticket 181323)
* We fixed an **Oops** pop-up window that appeared when opening the **View on Your device** dialog box while running an app with navigation profiles of the same kind. (Ticket 233598)
* We fixed an issue where the date format changed from 'dd-mm-yyyy' to 'dd-mm-y' when upgrading to Java 21. (Ticket 234598)
* We fixed an issue where the creation of an index failed when one of its attributes was not available on the offline database. (Ticket 239701)
* We received reports of multiple tasks being scheduled for the same scheduled event. To handle this situation gracefully, we now clean up the superfluous tasks on startup. Additionally we introduced extra logging to help diagnosing these issues.

### Known Issues

* Studio Pro on Mac loads user settings from the previous version of the application.

## 10.12.12 {#101212}

**Release date: January 27, 2025**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.12.12" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.12.12 from the Marketplace" %}}

### Improvements

* We improved the **Move document** dialog box:
    * We removed the context menu from the dialog box.
    * We added an option to create a new module or folder in dialog box. 
    * We removed the **Show** option.

### Fixes

* <a id="fix-positioning-error"></a>We fixed a [known issue](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.6/#ki-positioning-error) with the logic editors where there was a positioning error when inserting a large element into a sequence flow.
* We fixed an issue where applications using the Dojo client sometimes broke which was caused by browser extensions injecting scripts into the page. (Ticket 236663)
* We fixed an issue where list view item actions were not working correctly in the native client. (Tickets 237875, 238176)
* We changed the expression editor on macOS to not use smart-quotes.
* We fixed an error that appeared when selecting a Team Server App in the **Branch Line Manager**.
* We fixed an issue in the error details reported by published OData services. For errors containing more than one error detail, such as when a client inserted an object with multiple required attributes missing from the request body, the order in which these details were produced was inconsistent. This inconsistency meant that changing the runtime version altered the order.
* In the logic editors, we fixed the highlighting of parameter objects when selected.
* We fixed an issue where an end-user used nanoflow-based homepages and the back behavior did not work correctly.
* We fixed an issue where a wrong homepage was shown briefly before the one configured when a nanoflow action finished loading.
* We fixed an issue where using the offline web profile caused errors when sessions were being cleaned up.
* We fixed an issue where migrating a Java 21 application reset the Java version to 11.

### Breaking Changes

* <a id="revert-listening"></a>We reverted [the fix](#listening-reverted) affecting listening between widgets. The issue will be addressed in a future release. (Ticket 206642)

### Known Issues

* Studio Pro on Mac loads user settings from the previous version of the application.

## 10.12.11 {#101211}

**Release date: January 2, 2025**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.12.11" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.12.11 from the Marketplace" %}}

### Improvements

* We added a custom runtime setting `DataStorage.OptimizeSecurityColumns` to optimize columns that are added to the SQL generated for retrieve actions to evaluate XPath constraints in entity access rules. (Ticket 229009)
* We have upgraded bundled Node.js version from v16 to v20.
* Studio Pro now uses the legacy expression editor by default on Windows. The modernized version can be activated via the **Preferences**.
* When installing Studio Pro, the ARM version of the Java Development Kit is installed on computers with an ARM CPU.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where roles assigned to a user are ignored momentarily during runtime. (Ticket 221900)
* We fixed an issue where filtering over system associations **owner** and **changedBy** in a Data grid 2 column failed to render. (Tickets 231167, 233168)
* We fixed an issue with external entities with a key that contained a string of unlimited length. Even after setting a length limit, the database table for the key still had unlimited length, which was a problem for databases that did not support indexes on unlimited strings. (Ticket 231700)
* We fixed an issue where items were incorrectly rendered as disabled in the native client in some cases. (Ticket 232033)
* We improved the memory usage of the Dojo client when running an app for an extended period of time by fixing several memory leaks that occurred when opening thousands of pages. (Ticket 232228)
* We fixed an issue where apps could not be opened after a merge conflict was resolved. (Ticket 233793)
* We fixed an issue with conversion where variables on a page were presented in a different order. This issue caused certain [widget event actions](/refguide/on-click-event/#actions) to change when upgrading to Studio Pro10.4 or above. Specifically the arguments of [Call Microflow](/refguide/on-click-event/#microflow-arguments) and [Call Nanoflow](/refguide/on-click-event/#nanoflow) referring to a selection were changed if the widget was nested in another widget exposing the same entity. Note that this change does not correct previously converted apps which may now have an unintended argument configuration for Event Actions. (Ticket 233988) 
* We fixed an issue where using the S3 storage service resulted in a warning like *If you are using Java 9+, you will need to include javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api as a dependency.* (Ticket 235163, 235904)
* We fixed an issue where a native mobile app was getting stuck when the internet connection was unstable. (Ticket 236653)
* We fixed an issue where Studio Pro crashed when pressing the <kbd>Edit</kbd> button in the edit view of a **Create variable** dialog box.
* We fixed an issue where pasting widgets from one document template to another threw an error.
* We fixed Studio Pro freezes that might happen when editing pages.
* We fixed an issue in consumed web services where some corrupted imported WSDL files gave neither a consistency error, nor an error pop-up window.
* We fixed an issue in the call REST service and call web service activities, where setting an empty timeout expression gave an error. Now it gives a consistency error.
* We fixed an issue in consumed OData services where using large metadata files caused an exception when finding associations (called **partners** in OData).
* We fixed an issue in the logic editors where adding an annotation to the first element of a loop would sometimes break displayed variable types (it was only a visual bug).
* We fixed an **Oops** dialog in the logic editors when an annotation was added and linked to a **Parameter**.
* We fixed several issues in the Offline Profile validations that caused an **Oops** pop-up window to appear.
* We fixed an issue where if the application failed to reload, it did not restart.
* We fixed an issue with the <kbd>Edit</kbd> and <kbd>Delete</kbd> buttons in the **Jar Dependency Exclusion** dialog: these buttons caused an error if the list was empty.
* We fixed an issue where user tasks from excluded workflows did not get properly converted when updating a Studio Pro app to 10.12.
  
### Known Issues

* A finished parallel split path that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict. Please note that "path" was called "branch" in earlier versions.
    * Fixed in [10.17.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.17/#fix-finished-parallel-split).
* There is a positioning error in the logic editors when you are dragging a large element, such as a loop, into a sequence flow, it overlaps with the existing elements.
    * Fixed in [10.12.12](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.12/#fix-positioning-error) and in [10.14.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.14/#fix-positioning-error).
* Studio Pro on Mac loads user settings from the previous version of the application.

## 10.12.10 {#101210}

**Release date: November 25, 2024**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.12.10" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.12.10 from the Marketplace" %}}

### Improvements

* We added the ability to change the Studio Pro log level via the **Help Menu > Support Tools**.
* You can now enable a simplified version of the dialog box that appears when Studio Pro is executing an operation via the **Help Menu** > **Support Tools**.
* We optimized the memory consumption when using the **Refresh** button in **Stories** and when closing an app after the **App Settings** dialog box was opened.
* We updated the version of .NET Runtime to version 8.0.10.
* We improved code syntax highlighting in certain editors especially in the dark mode.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where a data validation error triggered on a rollback or a delete. We now remove data validation errors for objects that are rolled back or deleted. Any validation errors that you generate manually using a [validation feedback](/refguide/validation-feedback/) action will also be removed when an object is rolled back or deleted. (Ticket 192090)
* We removed changing condition values on flows in the logic editors through the Logic Recommender. (Tickets 213544, 216126, 216721)
* We fixed an issue when images synchronization took considerable amount of time. (Ticket 226400)
* We fixed an issue in the Dojo client where a microflow using **Close all pages** activity followed by an **Open page** activity failed to open the page in specific situations after using the browser's back button. (Ticket 229707)
* We improved the client performance of the Data Grid 2 widget configured with custom content columns. (Ticket 229940)
* We fixed an issue where scheduled events stopped being rescheduled after database connection issues occurred. (Ticket 230873)
* We fixed an issue during app deployment:  widgets with [On-change events](/refguide/on-click-event/#on-change) accepting parameters triggered an error when used inside a snippet. (Ticket 233500)
* We have fixed an issue when the sidebar was shown on a different page: the sidebar was shown on the main page.
* We fixed an issue where a service worker in a PWA cached the *index.html*. This caused issues when a *new index.html* was generated, for instance, when migrating an application from the Dojo to the React client.
* We fixed an issue where an **Oops** pop-up window was displayed when opening the **Page Settings** dialog. Specifically, this occurred when opening the **Page Settings** dialog of a **Create object** action from a menu item.
* We fixed an issue where an **Oops** pop-up window was displayed when adding or changing the [custom validation](/refguide/common-widget-properties/#custom-validation) for a widget.
* We fixed an error that occurred in the **Call external action** activity of a microflow.
* We fixed an issue that the Version Selector remained open after launching Studio Pro.
* We fixed an error that occurred when the app was closed while error check was still active.
* We fixed an issue where trying to edit the name of an entity, attribute or association using <kbd>F2</kbd> in a read-only domain model. Previously this resulted in an error; now pressing <kbd>F2</kbd> does nothing.
* We fixed an issue where updating a consumed OData contract resulted in a readable entity  turning into a non-readable entity. Resolving the consistency error led to an error when one of the attributes had been deleted as well.
* We fixed an issue where Studio Pro threw the CE0570 (*URL not unique*) consistency error when a user undid removing a URL from a page or a microflow.
* We upgraded the Apache XML Graphics FOP dependency to fix CVE-2024-28168.

### Deprecations

* We dropped support for PostgreSQL 12, as it is no longer supported by the vendor.

### Known Issues

* A finished parallel split path that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict. Please note that "path" was called "branch" in earlier versions.
    * Fixed in [10.17.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.17/#fix-finished-parallel-split).
* Line endings in CSS files are not being handled properly, so when using [Revert All Changes](/refguide/using-version-control-in-studio-pro/) or performing other version-control operations, CSS files appear in the [Changes on Disk](/refguide/version-control-menu/#show-changes) dialog box.
    * Fixed in [10.18.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.18/#fix-line-endings).
* There is a positioning error in the logic editors when you are dragging a large element, such as a loop, into a sequence flow, it overlaps with the existing elements.
    * Fixed in [10.12.12](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.12/#fix-positioning-error) and in [10.14.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.14/#fix-positioning-error).

### Improvements

* Logs generated from Git (our version control system) are now automatically directed into a dedicated subdirectory within the main logs folder.

### Fixes

* We fixed an exception (the **Oops** pop-up window) that occurred when an unknown variable was being used in the microflow expression editor. (Ticket 222410)
* We fixed an issue on Android where swiping back caused the app to get stuck on a blank screen. (Ticket 230312)
* We fixed an issue in offline apps that after synchronization an object was not found by the **Retrieve By Association** action in case of a reverse association traversal. (Ticket 231027)
* We fixed an issue that resulted in an **Oops** pop-up window when using the Combo Box widget and accessing its **Properties** pane. (Ticket 231451)

### Fixes

* <a id="fix-import-platform-supported-module"></a>We fixed an [known issue](#import-platform-supported-module) where importing a platform-supported Marketplace module containing a Java action failed when the project did not have managed Java dependencies or when Gradle synchronization for managed Java dependencies was disabled.
* <a id="fix-upgrade-platform-supported-module"></a>We fixed a [known issue](#upgrade-platform-supported-module) where upgrading a platform-supported Marketplace module containing a Java action failed. Or where adding a platform supported module that contained Java dependencies that were already used by the project failed. (Tickets 230929, 231115)
* We fixed an issue where the default date patterns for the English language required the user to insert a non-breaking space in date and time input fields. (Ticket 225500)
* We fixed an issue in published REST services in Studio Pro, where in exceptional cases it showed an error about not being able to refresh the grid.
* We fixed an issue in the **Operations** field of a published REST service, where double-clicking a consistency error showed an error rather than the operation with its parameters.
* We fixed an issue in Studio Pro for PMP where newly created PMP app repeatedly prompted users for credentials, blocking access with persistent pop-ups.

### Known Issues

## 10.12.7 {#10127}

**Release date: October 11, 2024**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.12.7" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.12.7 from the Marketplace" %}}

### Improvements

* We added support for PostgreSQL 17.
* We added the possibility to collect helpful information for support about the current Studio Pro process and overall status of the of process, such as  CPU, memory usage, child processes, threads.
* We updated the **Show Image** option (for instance, in the page editor) to select the corresponding image in the **Image Collection** that opens.
* We added a new setting in **Preferences** > **Deployment** that disables the synchronization of managed Java dependencies. This can be used to start an application even if Gradle synchronization fails, for example in an air-gapped environment. Note that this may result in compilation errors if Java dependencies are missing, and you must handle duplication and version conflicts manually. SBOM generation is not supported when synchronization is disabled.
* We now include Java dependencies in exported app and module packages. These are used if Gradle synchronization is disabled.

### Fixes

* We fixed [CVE-2023-49069](/releasenotes/security-advisories/#49069).

* We fixed an issue where a named user with multiple tabs open containing changes attempted to execute a runtime operation after session expiry. While one tab reloaded correctly on executing the action, the other tabs did not reload and retained invalid read-only change hashes which resulted in invalid hash errors. (Ticket 228140, 228296)
* We fixed an issue that made it impossible to start Studio Pro for the first time when there was no internet connection available.
* We fixed an issue when you selected an app and the loading spinner stayed visible forever even when loading apps had finished.
* We fixed an issue where bottom bar navigation was not working as expected.
* We fixed an error that happened when switching tabs in the Published OData service.
* We fixed some spurious foreign key constraint violation errors when using the built-in database (HSQLDB) and workflows with multiple threads.
* We fixed an issue where an incorrectly configured template (or data) broke page navigation.

### Known Issues

* <a id="import-platform-supported-module"></a>Importing a platform-supported Marketplace module containing a Java action fails when the project does not have managed Java dependencies or when Gradle synchronization for managed Java dependencies is disabled. In these cases there is no `vendorlib` folder in the project directory, causing the import to fail.
    * Fixed in [10.6.17](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.6/#fix-import-platform-supported-module) and [10.12.8](#fix-import-platform-supported-module).
* <a id="upgrade-platform-supported-module"></a>Upgrading a platform-supported Marketplace module containing a Java action fails. Or adding a platform supported module that contains Java dependencies that are already used by the project fails. In these cases the project `vendorlib` directory already contains the same *.jar* files as the new module, which will fail the import process.
    * Fixed in [10.6.17](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.6/#fix-import-platform-supported-module) and [10.12.8](#fix-upgrade-platform-supported-module).
* A finished parallel split path that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict. Please note that "path" was called "branch" in earlier versions.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue in import mapping where creating a microflow for object handling would throw an exception when there were duplicate attribute names (Tickets 201905, 217287).
* We resolved a navigation issue affecting apps with sidebar drawers. (Ticket 221824)
* We fixed an issue where the garbage collector cleaned up objects being returned from a microflow before they could be returned, leading to an error. (Ticket 222075)

### Known Issues

* A finished parallel split path that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict. Please note that "path" was called "branch" in earlier versions.
    * Fixed in [10.17.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.17/#fix-finished-parallel-split).

* We added support for MariaDB 11.4.
* We added support for MySQL 8.4.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where a native app was stuck starting over and over again in case the authentication token was no longer valid. We now clear the authentication and session cookie in case they are no longer valid. (Ticket 225198)
* We fixed an issue where Studio Pro crashed when using <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> in the Expression editor. (Tickets  225645, 226153)

* We fixed an issue where the `instantiate` XAS API was incorrectly available when Strict Mode was enabled.
* We fixed an issue where an **Oops** dialog box was shown when a generated column filter in a Data grid 2 is moved to another column.
* We fixed an issue in the Data grid 2 widget where setting a reference data source for filtering over associations in a column, triggered an automatic content generation.
* We fixed an issue where an **Oops** dialog box appeared if the source variable object (**Create object**, Parameter, etc.) was deleted while extracting submicroflow.
* We fixed an issue where a wrong error message appeared if all variables were already selected while extracting submicroflow.
* In the logic editors, we fixed an issue where a retrieve over association did not show the correct data type when it involved a generalization of an entity instead of the entity itself.

### Deprecations

* We dropped support for MariaDB 10.4, as it is no longer supported by the vendor.
* We will drop support for PostgreSQL 12 after November 14 2024, as the vendor has announced the end of support for that version.

### Known Issues

* A finished parallel split path that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict. Please note that "path" was called "branch" in earlier versions.
    * Fixed in [10.17.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.17/#fix-finished-parallel-split).
* Line endings in CSS files are not being handled properly, so when using [Revert All Changes](/refguide/using-version-control-in-studio-pro/) or performing other version-control operations, CSS files appear in the [Changes on Disk](/refguide/version-control-menu/#show-changes) dialog box.
    * Fixed in [10.18.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.18/#fix-line-endings).
* There is a positioning error in the logic editors when you are dragging a large element, such as a loop, into a sequence flow, it overlaps with the existing elements.
    * Fixed in [10.12.12](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.12/#fix-positioning-error) and in [10.14.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.14/#fix-positioning-error).
* Studio Pro on Mac loads user settings from the previous version of the application.

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.12.2" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.12.2 from the Marketplace" %}}

### Improvements

* We upgraded the JDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server to version 12.6.3. If you connect to SQL Server using integrated security in a module such as [Database Connector](/appstore/modules/database-connector/), you may need to update the JDBC driver in `userlib` as well.
* We improved performance when typing in the expression editor.
* We added an [`mx show-java-version` command](/refguide/mx-command-line-tool/app/#show-java-version) to the mx command-line tool. This command shows the configured Java version of the app.

### New Features

#### Mendix AI Assistance (Maia)

With Mendix 10.12, we are releasing [Mendix AI Assistance (Maia)](/refguide/mendix-ai-assistance/), our new generative AI-powered assistant designed to help you as developers during your application development lifecycle. Maia can answer Mendix development questions, automate certain development tasks, and even generate parts of your app. 

Below is a list of Maia features introduced in this release:

* We rebranded MendixChat to [Maia Chat](/refguide/maia-chat/) and released it for general availability (GA). It has been given a fresh new design. You can use the sparkle button at the Studio Pro top bar, to easily open Maia Chat.
* We rebranded MxAssist Best Practice Bot to [Maia Best Practice Recommender](/refguide/best-practice-recommender/).
* We rebranded MxAssist Logic Bot to [Maia Logic Recommender](/refguide/logic-recommender/) in the logic editors.
* We introduced the new [Maia Workflow Recommender](/refguide/workflow-recommender/) that provides assistance during development in the workflow editor and helps you build workflows faster. It currently suggests activities with useful properties, for instance, a user task with a user-targeting microflow (only microflows that are applicable for user targeting), or Jump activities with only/all allowed activities to jump to.
* The Recommenders are enabled by default and can now be disabled via Studio Pro **Preferences** > **Maia** > **In-Editor Recommender**.
* We added a new experimental feature [Maia Translation Generator](/refguide/translation-generator/) to **Language** > **Batch Translate...**. You can enable it via Studio Pro **Preferences** > **New Features**.

#### Primitive Parameters Support for Logic Called from Pages

It is now possible to pass primitive values from pages to microflows and nanoflows. You can now use [expressions](/refguide/expressions/) to set primitive values as arguments (like a string or Boolean), use functions, and even follow associations! This can be used on triggering call microflow and call nanoflow client [actions](/refguide/on-click-event/#call-microflow), and also as in data sources based on microflows or nanoflows.

The advantage is that microflows and nanoflows can now more easily be (re)used when they have primitive parameters, as they can be called directly from a page. Previously, multiple microflows or nanoflows had to be used, or a non-persistable entity had to be introduced in both the logic and UI. Not anymore!

For example, picture a page allowing the user to approve or deny a request using o separate buttons. Before this feature, each button would require their own microflow. Now both buttons can call the same microflow passing the status as a primitive argument. Plain and simple.

In general, logic that has primitive parameters can be more easily reused as it is not tied to the domain model. Thus, this feature also improves overall reusability. You can imagine how much easier and faster this makes modeling!

Thank you [Jelle](https://community.mendix.com/link/space/microflows/ideas/100), [Laurens](https://community.mendix.com/link/space/microflows/ideas/2159), [Christiaan](https://community.mendix.com/link/space/microflows/ideas/174), [Tim](https://community.mendix.com/link/space/studio-pro/ideas/1170), and [Christian](https://community.mendix.com/link/space/microflows/ideas/2323)! 

#### Using Associations with External Actions

**Published OData services** now supports including associated objects when calling a microflow that is published as an OData action. When consuming these actions in a **Call External Action** activity, Studio Pro lets you select the associations that should be included in the action call. These associated objects are then included in the request to the **Consumed OData service**. If the service returns an object or a list of objects, you can also specify which associations you want to get back from the service. These associations can then be traversed using the **Retrieve** activity. 

If you call the published OData service using a REST client, you can nest the associated objects in the request body and use the `$expand` query parameter to control which associated objects should be returned in the response.

#### Strict Mode for React Client

For the React client, we are introducing a strict mode. Setting up access rules correctly can be a challenge. Strict mode helps make your app secure, even if its overlapping access rules are not set up perfectly. Strict mode ensures that entities are exclusively accessible as defined within your model through microflows, nanoflows, widgets, or pages. 

It restricts invoking certain client APIs through JavaScript Actions or via the browser's console. The following APIs for data manipulation or retrieval are restricted: `action`, `create`, `commit`, `remove`, `rollback`, and `get` (except by GUID or GUIDs). 

Moreover, your model is analyzed by Studio Pro to ensure that only entities within editable widgets can be saved during a save changes action. Fore more information, see [Strict Mode](/refguide/strict-mode/).

#### Other New Features

* Consumed OData services now support external enumerations that have reserved words as values.
* In published OData services, you can now choose to publish a string attribute as an OData GUID.
* You can now specify the service URL and proxy settings of a consumed OData service using a microflow.
* You can now export the service feed, metadata and OpenAPI documents of a published OData service by right-clicking the service in the app explorer.
* We introduced support for indexes in the offline databases for offline PWAs and Native Mobile.
* Associations are automatically indexed. Attributes (or sets of attributes) can be indexed by configuring the index in the entity properties by checking the **Include in offline** checkbox.

### Managed Dependencies Improvements 

* We renamed the **Deployment** tab to **Dependencies** in the **App settings**. 
* We added an **Overview** section in the **Dependencies** tab of the **App settings**. In this section you can see all the configured dependencies in the application and you can see in which modules they are defined.
* We added an **Managed Dependency Exclusions** section in the **Dependencies** tab of the **App settings**. In this section you can exclude managed dependencies from the app deployment. Use this if there are conflicts beeen dependencies in your application.
* You can now configure exclusions for managed dependencies in the **Module Settings**. Using this feature you can exclude certain transitive dependencies from a managed dependency to fix conflicts and ensure these transitive dependencies will not be included in your project.

### Improvements

* JavaScript actions now support optional parameters. This feature enhances flexibility and ensures backward compatibility of JavaScript actions by allowing new parameters to be added without breaking existing functionality. 
* In JavaScript actions, all parameter types can set to be required or not. If no argument is provided for an optional parameter, it defaults to undefined. You can handle optional parameters within the JavaScript action by checking if they are undefined, allowing you to assign default values or implement custom logic as needed.
* In Java actions, optional parameters without mappings will no longer trigger a consistency error (CE0115).
* We added an improvement (public beta) which allows you to use [partial application clones](/refguide/clone-type/) with Git instead of full clones. Partial clones download a minimum required set of data, making this method significantly faster than full clones when working with [large repositories](/refguide/troubleshoot-repository-size/). Through **Open app** settings or version control preferences, you can choose which cloning strategy to use for future cloning operations, such as downloading a new app or branch.
* We added an improvement where if you use parameters in the body of a Consumed REST Request (beta), the parameters that are not defined yet get added automatically to the parameter tab with empty test values.
* We optimized data retrieval in [Optimize for Neork Load mode](/refguide/datasource-runtime/#optimize-for-network-load) even further. Entity paths in expressions now only retrieve the ID attributes of associated objects.
* We fixed memory leaks that can happen while using a context menu.
* We fixed memory leaks that happened when opening and closing page editors.
* We aligned the icons of the Visual Builder for XPath Constraints with XPath Expression editor.

* We moved the Visual Builder for XPath Constraints is now GA (it was in public beta).

* Selection can now be modified by the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd> key, either by a single click or by dragging a selection rectangle, allowing for more precise control in selecting elements in logic flow editors.
* You can now convert the [reference set selector](/refguide/reference-set-selector/) widget to the combo box widget using the **Convert to combo box** context menu option.
* We improved the OpenAPI document generated for a published OData service. The public documentation of published microflows is now included as the summary and description of the operation, rather than the path. This makes it appear in consumers such as Swagger UI.
* We improved rendering performance on the logic editors when working with large documents.
* We improved the query performance for inserts and updates on the offline database (both for PWA and native mobile).
* We redesigned the **Toolbox** to give it the same look and feel for both Windows and macOS without changing the functionality. You can switch to the newer version by clicking **Edit** > **Preferences** > **New Features**.

* We added support for the following languages: Telugu (India), Odia (India), Kannada (India), Malayalam (India).
* We updated the version of .NET Runtime Studio Pro uses to version 8.0.6.

* We added the option to define the return variable name for microflow and nanoflow calls. You can now give a name to the returned value of the nanoflow or microflow through the end event form.
* We made several improvements to the microflow editor. When dragging microflow/nanoflow calls into a flow (including from the **App Explorer**), we now correctly set the parameters of the call. Setting the parameters of the call now also takes the names of the variables into account and will match them by name to the parameter when possible. Thank you Peter Mudde for this suggestion!

* We aligned the pagination controls position of Data Grid 2 to the default bottom position while generating overview pages or converting from data grid to data grid 2.
* We renamed menu item **Reverse Merge Changes ....** to **Revert a Commit…**.
* We added the following additions to the [External Database Connector](/appstore/modules/external-database-connector/): 
    * GA for Snowflake connection
    * Support for connecting to Snowflake using Key-Pair Authentication
    * Passing NULL values to parameters
    * Connection detail constants are now saved in the active configuration of the user
    * Passwords and private keys are now stored as private values
    * Queries in the **Database Connection** document are mergeable
    * Logging for the **Database Connection** document
    * Improved Oracle connection string generation (for design time)

    {{% alert color="warning" %}}If you upgrade your app containing **External Database Connector** version 2.0.1 or below it will have compatibility issues which prevent you from building and deploying the app in Mendix version 10.12. To fix this, you will need to get **External Database Connector** version 3.0.0 or above from the Marketplace.{{% /alert %}}

### Fixes

* <a id="fix-workflow-parameter"></a>We fixed a [known issue](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.3/#ki-workflow-parameter) where the workflow's user task was not passed correctly as a parameter to the user task's microflow decision method.
* We fixed an issue in **Message Definition** where refreshing from schema did not update the attribute type. (Ticket 180156)
* We fixed an issue where the **Marketplace** pane in Studio Pro did not retain its position upon reopening Studio Pro. (Ticket 207933)
* We fixed an issue where retrieving more than 1000 objects together with a specialization of an associated entity returned incomplete results. (Ticket 211813)
* We added a check so that reimported modules only keep database IDs for attributes when a generalization of the entity remains in place. (Ticket 212565)
* We fixed an issue where long text in the design properties definition file caused the styling pane to stretch. (Ticket 214953)
* We fixed an issue which occurred when starting an app containing a consumed OData service that retrieves headers from a microflow. This logged an error that the headers microflow could not be found. (Ticket 214979)
* We fixed an issue in the Workflow Engine that caused the Mendix Runtime Server to run out of memory after deploying a new version of a workflow that had many decisions in it. (Ticket 215232) 
* We fixed an issue with searching in protected modules. (Ticket 216100)
* We fixed an issue that caused design properties to sometimes apply a change to the wrong widget. (Ticket 216125)
* We fixed an issue in the CORS configuration of published REST services. Specifying `*` for allowed origins now allows all origins. (Ticket 216564)
* We fixed the positioning of objects when dragging large objects onto flows in the logic editors.
* We fixed an issue where selection was lost in the **Message definition** tree view when the stored name no longer matches with the entity name in the domain model.
* We fixed an issue when updating a consumed OData contract where a non-readable entity becomes a readable entity. Resolving this consistency error leaded to an error when one of the attributes had been deleted as well.
* We fixed the workflow's user task to also validate its completion criteria on retry.
* We fixed the user task in workflows to only send a single **UserTaskStarted** event when microflow is used as the [decision method](/refguide/multi-user-task/#decision-method) to complete the task.
* We fixed an issue that caused an **Oops** dialog box when opening a published OData service that publishes deleted entities.
* We are now showing system members in the right-hand dropdown of the XPath Visual Builder. This fixes an issue where in certain scenarios the Visual Builder for XPath Constraints showed an **Oops** dialog box for an expression comparison containing system members. We also fixed an issue where toggling to the Expression Editor from the Visual Builder and back sometimes suddenly showed an **Advanced XPath** error when using system members in the XPath expression.
* The Column attribute selector of Data Grid 2 no longer shows an error when selecting **None**.
* We made some performance improvements when checking whether the running app can be updated without stopping it first.
* We fixed an exception that was thrown in the MPR tool when editing a metadata.

### Deprecations

* We deprecated the [Email Module](https://apidocs.rnd.mendix.com/9/runtime/com/mendix/modules/email/EmailModule.html) from public API. It is recommended to use the [Email Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/120739) instead.

### Known Issues

* Studio Pro on Mac loads user settings from the previous version of the application.
    * Fixed in [10.12.2](#fix-user-settings-mac) and [10.13.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.13/#fix-user-settings-mac).
* When importing Marketplace modules with Studio Pro, their version numbers do not represent the module's version. Instead they mention the current Studio Pro version. This does not affect previously imported Marketplace modules.
    * Fixed in [10.14.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.14/#fix-marketplace-modules).
* A finished parallel split path that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict. Please note that "path" was called "branch" in earlier versions.
    * Fixed in [10.17.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.17/#fix-finished-parallel-split).
* Line endings in CSS files are not being handled properly, so when using [Revert All Changes](/refguide/using-version-control-in-studio-pro/) or performing other version-control operations, CSS files appear in the [Changes on Disk](/refguide/version-control-menu/#show-changes) dialog box.
    * Fixed in [10.18.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.18/#fix-line-endings).
* There is a positioning error in the logic editors when you are dragging a large element, such as a loop, into a sequence flow, it overlaps with the existing elements.
    * Fixed in [10.12.12](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.12/#fix-positioning-error) and in [10.14.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.14/#fix-positioning-error).
