### New Features

- We made it possible to use the special 'back' and 'forward' mouse buttons to navigate the history of active editors in Studio Pro, when they are present on the mouse.

- We added support for retrieving the CSRF token using the new client API. You can now use "getCSRFToken" from "mx-api/session" to get the token, which is required when calling secured REST services.

### Improvements


- We extended the `FeedbackHelper.OpenFormFeedback` Java API to allow opening pages with multiple parameters.

- Data views are no longer needed to use page parameters when configuring [input elements](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/input-widgets/), pluggable widgets [attribute properties](https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-property-types/#attribute), and [snippet calls](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/snippet-call/#snippet-settings).
- Weâ€™ve updated our Terms of Use, we encourage you to review the updated Terms of Use when installing Studio Pro.
- We added transparency to disabled button icons in the toolbar.
We made Studio Pro start faster and consume less memory by improving the efficiency of the process that downloads and handles the images of the starter app templates.
We added support for dark mode to the 'Create New App' page in Studio Pro.
- We added support for Brazilian Portuguese to Studio Pro.
- The OpenAPI document of published OData services now uses OpenAPI version 3.0.4 where it used to use OpenAPI version 3.0.1.
- In the logic editors, when inserting elements with an attached annotation into a flow, we only make room for the inserted elements, not the annotation.
- We added the `com.mendix.core.conf.LicenseInfo#validateCustomerID(String)` method to the public API. This method can be used to check if a customer identity matches the one in the license of the running application. The `LicenseInfo` instance is available through `Core.getLicenseInformation()`.
- The `mx create-module-package` command will now also synchronize and include the managed dependencies of the module in the exported module package. This will allow the module to be used in a Studio Pro that has disabled Gradle synchronization. The `exclude-managed-dependencies` flag can be used to disable this behavior.
- We added the option to add extra arguments to the Gradle process in the Studio Pro preferences.
- We added the `extra-gradle-arguments` option to MxBuild. This option can be used to pass extra arguments to the Gradle process.
- We improved the entity and member access rights validation in the modernized entity access rules editor. We now display the reason when a specific right cannot be granted and check member access rights capabilities upfront.

- We improved the warning popup shown when converting between nanoflows: the "Find Usages" button has been renamed  to "Show Usages" and now only shows irreplaceable usages.
- The modernized entity access rules editor now supports viewing access rules for non-editable entities, such as system entities.

### Fixes


- We fixed an issue where, when updating an association from an entity to its own specialization on an instance of the specialization, the association would be set in the opposite direction. (Ticket 245140)
- We have fixed the behaviour of the `urlEncode` and `urlDecode` functions in the client to align with the runtime. This means that spaces are now correctly encoded as `%20` instead of `+`. `urlDecode` still supports decoding strings containing `+` to ensure backwards compatibility with strings encoded in previous versions (ticket 245510).
We have fixed scenarios when the edited value in the tree control is not saved, even when the cell loses focus (i.e. edit value -> click on the expander button).
- We fixed scenarios when keyboard shortcuts are not processed correctly in the expression editor.
We have fixed the vertical scrollbar for the data grid in the version selector.
- We fixed the issue that, when exporting suppression rules from the 'Manage Suppression Rules' dialog, any recently made changes to the rules would not be included in the export.
- We fixed a potential issue related to saving user settings in the app folder when the app folder is moved or renamed.
- We fixed the way how multiline text is displayed in the Enumerations document.
- We fixed the issue that in the 'Select App' / 'Open App' dialog only the local names of apps would be shown, instead of the names from the online portal.
- We fixed a cut off label ('Customize for dark mode') in the Java action editor form.
- We fixed an issue when wrong text is shown in a question dialog after languages are removed from application. (Ticket 248967)
- We fixed an issue in view entities in Studio Pro. When running an OQL query Studio Pro would show decimal value `0` as `0E-8` and it would show other decimal values with trailing zeroes.
- We fixed an issue where Studio Pro would show an exception dialog while checking the consistency of external attributes, associations and enumerations.
- In the logic editors, we fixed a possible Oops dialog when starting a remote debugging session
- In the logic editors, we fixed a bug where we showed a CW0114 warning for microflows even though they were used in the project. (Tickets 184859, 186059, 215091, 216988)
- In the logic editors, we fixed a bug that caused empty canvases to not render correctly.
- We fixed an issue that caused all the widgets to shift to the right in Design mode on React Client enabled.
- We improved the generation of Java code for enumerations. 
- We fixed an issue where captions for enumerations did not return the caption in the default language, if no caption was available for the request language code.
- We fixed an issue where having a disabled and detached activity in a Microflow would cause the Microflow to not execute the main flow. (Ticket 243133)
- We fixed an issue where exporting a module would give a "Unknown dependency synchronization error.". This could occur if the module contained managed dependencies which have both JVM and Android versions, such as Google Guava.
- We fixed an issue where metadata got corrupted due to the presence of special characters.
- We fixed an issue where the 'Revert change' option was missing for deleted files in the Changes pane.
- We fixed an issue with offline mode, where data sources did not react to updates to attributes used in XPath constraints.
