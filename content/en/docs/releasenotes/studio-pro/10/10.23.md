### New Features

- You can now use the special <kbd>Back</kbd> and <kbd>Forward</kbd> mouse buttons to navigate through the history of active editors in Studio Pro â€” if your mouse has them. {TW}

- We added support for retrieving the CSRF token using the new client API. You can now use `getCSRFToken` from `mx-api/session` to get the token, which is required when calling secured REST services.

### Improvements


- We extended the `FeedbackHelper.OpenFormFeedback` Java API to allow opening pages with multiple parameters.

- Data views are no longer needed to use page parameters when configuring [input elements](/refguide/input-widgets/), pluggable widgets [attribute properties](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pluggable-widgets-property-types/#attribute), and [snippet calls](/refguide/snippet-call/#snippet-settings).
- We updated our Terms of Use, we recommend you to review the updated Terms of Use when installing Studio Pro.
- We added transparency to disabled toolbar button icons for better visibility.
- We made Studio Pro start faster and consume less memory by improving the efficiency of the process that downloads and handles the images of the Starter app templates.
- We added support for the dark mode to the **Create New App** page.
- We added support for Brazilian Portuguese to Studio Pro. {TW}
- The OpenAPI document of published OData services now uses OpenAPI version 3.0.4 where it used to use OpenAPI version 3.0.1.
- In the logic editors, when inserting elements with an attached annotation into a flow, we only make room for the inserted elements, not the annotation. {TW}
- We added the `com.mendix.core.conf.LicenseInfo#validateCustomerID(String)` method to the public API. This method can be used to check if a customer identity matches the one in the license of the running application. The `LicenseInfo` instance is available through `Core.getLicenseInformation()`.
- The `mx create-module-package` command now also synchronizes with and includes the managed dependencies of the module in the exported module package. This allows the module to be used in Studio Pro with Gradle synchronization disabled. The `exclude-managed-dependencies` flag can be used to disable this behavior.
- We added the option to add extra arguments to the Gradle process in the Studio Pro **Preferences**.
- We added the `extra-gradle-arguments` option to MxBuild. This option can be used to pass extra arguments to the Gradle process.
- We improved the entity and member access rights validation in the modernized Entity Access Rules editor. We now display the reason when a specific right cannot be granted and check member access rights capabilities upfront.

- The modernized Entity Access Rules editor now supports viewing access rules for non-editable entities, such as System entities.

- We improved the warning pop-up shown when converting between nanoflows: the **Find Usages** button was renamed  to **Show Usages** and now shows only irreplaceable usages. {TW}

### Fixes


- We fixed an issue where, when updating an association from an entity to its own specialization on an instance of the specialization, the association was be set in the opposite direction. (Ticket 245140)
- \- We fixed the behavior of the `urlEncode` and `urlDecode` functions in the client to align with the runtime. This means that spaces are now correctly encoded as `%20` instead of `+`. `urlDecode` still supports decoding strings containing `+` to ensure backwards compatibility with strings encoded in previous versions. (Ticket 245510)
- We have fixed scenarios when the edited value in the tree control is not saved, even when the cell loses focus (i.e. edit value -> click on the expander button). {TW}
- We fixed issues where keyboard shortcuts were not processed correctly in the Expression editor.
- We fixed the vertical scrollbar for the data grid in the Version Selector.
- We fixed an issue where recent changes to suppression rules were not included when exporting them from the **Manage Suppression Rules** dialog.
- We fixed a potential issue related to saving user settings in the app folder when the app folder is moved or renamed.
- We fixed the way how multiline text is displayed in the **Enumerations** document.
- We fixed the issue where only local changes were displayed in the **Select App** and **Open App** dialogs instead of displaying names from the Mendix portal.
- We fixed an issue where the **Customize for dark mode** label was cut off in the Java Action editor.
- We fixed an issue where a wrong text is shown in a dialog after languages were removed from the app. (Ticket 248967)
- We fixed an issue in view entities in Studio Pro: when running an OQL query Studio Pro showed decimal value `0` as `0E-8` and it showed other decimal values with trailing zeroes.
- We fixed an issue where Studio Pro showed an exception dialog while checking the consistency of external attributes, associations and enumerations.
- In the logic editors, we fixed a possible error dialog when starting a remote debugging session.
- In the logic editors, we fixed a bug where we showed a CW0114 warning for microflows even though they were used in the project. (Tickets 184859, 186059, 215091, 216988) {TW}
- In the logic editors, we fixed a bug that caused empty working areas to not render correctly.
- We fixed an issue that caused all the widgets to shift to the right in Design mode on React Client enabled.
- We improved the generation of Java code for enumerations. 
- We fixed an issue where enumeration captions did not return the caption in the default language, if no caption was available for the requested language code. 
- We fixed an issue where having a disabled and detached activity in a microflow caused the microflow to not execute the main flow. (Ticket 243133)
- We fixed an issue where exporting a module gave an **Unknown dependency synchronization** error. This occured if the module contained managed dependencies which have both JVM and Android versions, such as Google Guava.
- We fixed an issue where metadata got corrupted when special characters were present.
- We fixed an issue where the **Revert change** option was missing for deleted files in the **Changes** pane.
- We fixed an issue with offline mode, where data sources did not react to updates of attributes used in XPath constraints.
