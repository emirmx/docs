### New Features

- We introduced a new message for Maia generation session which allows to either navigate back to the document related to a session or create a new Generate session for the currently active document.
We added a new menu option "Contact Support" into "Help > Support Tools", this will allow users to reach the support website directly from Studio Pro.
- We enabled the History Navigation Arrows by default and moved the navigation settings to the "Work Environment" tab.
- You can now use the mx tool to see which private values Studio Pro has stored on you local app data, and delete these values.
- When opening an existing app in Studio Pro, it now automatically converts to the MPRV2 format.
- MPRv1 apps need to be converted to MPRv2 to be able to commit, for .mpr files larger than 250MB. By default, conversion to MPRv2 happens automatically.
We have introduced a new feature that allows users to add the app folder to the Microsoft Defender exclusions list.

### Improvements


* We improved the performance of workflow versioning conflict analysis for workflows with many nested outcome-based activities. (Ticket 242615)
- The variables of pages and snippets are now available in XPath constraints.
- We have renamed Domain Model Generator and Page Generator to Maia for Domain Model and Maia for Pages.
- Update the dotnet runtime version installed with Studio Pro.
- In OQL queries you can now use `NULL` in `CAST` expressions when you want to cast an empty value to either `DATETIME`, `DECIMAL`, `INTEGER`, `LONG` or `STRING`. This was already supported in OQL execution in Java actions, but Studio Pro would add an error when this was used in view entities or data sets.
- We improved the live preview of view entities in Studio Pro. Columns that represent associations now show the entity name in the header, and when there is no associated object the cell is empty.
- You can now copy from the *Run Query* table in view entities in Studio Pro.
- We fixed an issue in Consumed OData services where the URI resolution would fail if the service returned a next link.
- In the logic editors, we now highlight the loop border when dragging elements inside of it.
- In logic editors, we improved the scrollbar styling as well as interaction when clicking on the scrollbar track.
- In the logic editors, we fixed some layouting glitches when adding objects to flows
- In the logic editors, we move connected elements out of the way when an element is resized.
- In the logic editors, we made connection points and resize handles only visible on element selected
- We've updated react-native-reanimated to the latest version.
- We've updated @react-navigation to the latest version.
- headerTruncatedBackTitle was deprecated in @react-navigation version 7. If the title is too long, @react-navigation will handle it itself.
- We made the text in the dialog that is shown when a page could not be found translatable (ticket 242035).
- The authentication token is now rotated, ensuring a new token is generated upon session expiration for enhanced security.
- In the security overview and the modernized entity access rules editor, inherited attributes and associations from an entity's generalization are now marked with a distinct inherited icon.
- We made it easier to use variables for pages and snippets. The variables are now available in the value selectors of conditional visibility, conditional editability, and text templates.
- The **Connector** pane now features page and snippet variables.

### Fixes

- We fixed an issue where the "Generate validation microflow" feature in the page editor would show an Oops dialog.
- We fixed an issue where Consumed Web Service causing validation failure in runtime for WSDL files imported locally. (Ticket 146066)

- We fixed an issue in Message definitions where custom names were reset on expansion of a node. (Tickets 222597, 227958, 236152, 232930, 240806, 241561, 244349)
- We fixed an issue where an app crash occurs when 'Call a microflow' is selected and select button is clicked in the Map entity dialog. (Ticket 225433)

- We now import only one content-type header from open api contract in Consumed REST Service. (Beta feature)
- We fixed an issue in the React client where the document title would briefly be 'Mendix' during startup instead of the title configured in the application (ticket 245280).
- We fixed an issue where not all changes were correctly updated in the runtime after a local deployment. For example when adding or removing columns to your datagrid 2 widget.
- We have removed the setting and the changes related to the `MaxRetrieveSize` custom runtime setting as it had unforeseen consequences. This fixes issues where synchronization and retrieve by association in a microflow would be limited by this setting.
- We fixed an issue where an Oops dialog was shown when extracting widgets that use an 'unknown' entity type into a snippet.
We fixed an issue where the "Download Latest Version" button in the app selector would download the latest Windows version for MacOS users.
- We fixed an unnecesary redirect when creating a new app from the Mendix Portal.
- We fixed an OOPs dialog that might appear upon clicking a button that accepts changes to it's enabled state (i.e. Enabled -> Disabled).
- We fixed an OOPs dialog that could have appeared after clicking cancel in a progress dialog.
- We fixed F9 view app shortcut. It is used to view the currently running app in the browser. (ticket #243743)
- The command line tools should now support arm64 architectures without the need of installing the dotnet runtime x64.
- We fixed an issue where Studio Pro would crash when collecting support info without a project open.
- We made the context menu that opens in the Page editor or Microflow editor to be capable to navigate via the arrow-buttons.

- We fixed an issue where fields that could not be unchecked while Export mapping an XML schema or Consumed Web Service were not checked and expanded by default when selecting the document schema source for the first time. (Ticket 232274)
- We fixed an issue in OQL view entities in Studio Pro, where setting write access to an association would incorrectly result in consistency error CE6593.
- We fixed an issue where Studio Pro would evaluate the type of a COALESCE function expression for numeric arguments to be the type that can contain the types of all provided arguments, which is not in line with the bahaviour at runtime. It now evaluates to be equal to the type of the first argument.
- We fixed an issue in the live preview of view entities, where for very large values Studio Pro would show an incorrect value.
- We fixed an issue in the runtime execution of the Send External Object microflow activity, which would log a warning when the remote key mapping had already been stored in the database. It does not log this warning anymore.
- We fixed an issue in the Integration pane where clicking "Show details" on a Business Event search result would display elements from a locally existing version of the service.
- We fixed an issue in published REST and OData services where calling the service using active session authentication with an expired CSRF token in Javascript would cause the browser to show a Username/Password popup (Ticket 243407).

- We fixed an issue in published REST and OData services which would respond with a WWW-Authenticate header for all 401 Not Authorized responses, even when Basic authentication was not enabled for the service.
- In the logic editors, we fixed an issue where multiple identical parameters were generated if a parameter or variable was used more than once by the selection to extract. (Ticket 242517)
- In the logic editors, we fixed the displayed data type for cross-module 1-to-1 associations (Ticket 245052)
- In the logic editors, we no longer truncate variable names.
- In the modernized toolbox, we fixed an issue where the toolbox would not refresh after synchronizing the app directory to load new widgets. (Ticket 237560)
- We fixed an issue in the logic editors where some automatically generated variable names were accidentally translated.
- We fixed an issue where cookies were not cleared before starting new anonymous session.
- When using a related entity predicate in an offline app where the related entity has sub entities, the XPath would not give the results of the sub entities. This has been fixed.
- We fixed an issue (introduced in 10.21) that causes microflow calls to fail in offline apps when there is a non-persistent entity that both associates either the current user or the current session and an yet unsynchronized offline object.
- We fixed the checkbox "Show inactive threads (wait/park)" in Runtime Threads window of Studio Pro.
- We fixed an issue where the runtime fails to start with a `NullPointerException` when an invalid disabled activity is present in any microflow.(Ticket 243931)
- We have replaced usages of deprecated methods in the generated code.
- We removed the import of the deprecated `com.mendix.webui.CustomJavaAction` class in generated code.
- We fixed a Studio Pro crash which happened when logging a list of strings from a Java action. (Ticket 243124)
- We fixed the date format preview in Studio Pro to be consistent with the actual date formatting behaviour in the runtime and client.
- We fixed an issue where disabling the "Multiple sessions per user" setting incorrectly killed all existing user sessions and deleted all associated tokens, including the currently valid one (Ticket 238657).
- We fixed associations owned by both the parent and child entity not showing up as an association  in the modernized entity access rules editor for the child entity.
- We updated the "Create" entity right icon in the security overview to match the icon used in the modernized entity access rules editor.
- We fixed an issue where the `Substract`, `Union` and `Intersect` list operations did not always return a list with unique values when used in a nanoflow (ticket 240695).
- We reapplied a fix for an issue affecting listening between widgets. (Ticket 206642)
- We fixed an issue where data sources with a default configuration triggered an Oops dialog when hidden by another property.
- We fixed an Oops dialog that occurred when reconfiguring a data source with an invalid expression referring to it.
- We fixed an issue with editing expressions where the expected type was **Not set** when its target was a page or snippet variable. For example static values for Combobox.
- We addressed a performance degradation during deployment involving widgets with text templates. (Ticket 245543)

### Breaking Changes

- We updated the date formatting in the client to be consistent with the runtime in supporting genitive and abbrivated month names. See the table below for the changes between the old and new formatting. The runtime formatting has not changed and is equal to the new client behaviour.

| token | old       | new
|-------|-----------|--------
| MMM   | genitive  | genitive abbrivated
| MMMM  | genitive  | genitive
| LLL   | genitive  | standalone abbrivated
| LLLL  | genitive  | standalone
