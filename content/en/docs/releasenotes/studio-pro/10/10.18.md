{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.18.6" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.18.6 from the Marketplace" %}}

### Improvements

* We made the text in the dialog that is shown when a page could not be found translatable. (Ticket 242035)

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where Consumed Web Service caused validation failure in runtime for WSDL files imported locally. (Ticket 146066)
* We fixed an issue in **Message** definitions where custom names were reset on expansion of a node. (Tickets 222597, 227958, 236152, 232930, 240806, 241561, 244349)
* We fixed an issue where an app crashed when a **Call a microflow** event was selected then the **Select** button was clicked in the **Map entity** dialog. (Ticket 225433)
* We fixed an issue where Export mapping schema elements with forced selections were not automatically selected and expanded when choosing the document schema source for the first time using XML schema or Consumed Web Service as the schema source. (Ticket 232274)
* In the modernized **Toolbox**, we fixed an issue where the **Toolbox** did not refresh after synchronizing the app directory to load new widgets. (Ticket 237560)
* In the logic editors, we fixed the displayed data type for cross-module one-to-one associations. (Ticket 245052)
* We fixed an issue in the React client where the document title was briefly **Mendix** during startup instead of the title configured in the application. (Ticket 245280)
* We addressed a performance degradation during deployment involving widgets with text templates. (Ticket 245543)
* We fixed an issue where the page editor's **Generate validation microflow** feature did show an **Oops** pop-up window.
* We fixed an issue where the **Download Latest Version** button in the app selector downloaded the latest Windows version for MacOS users.
* We fixed an unnecessary redirect that occurred when creating a new app from the Mendix Portal.
* The command line tools now support ARM64 architectures without installing the .NET runtime x64.
* The context menus which open in the page editor and microflow editors can now be navigated via arrow keys.
* We fixed an issue where an app using the React client did not get updated correctly in production due to a caching issue.
* We fixed an **Oops** pop-u window that occurred when reconfiguring a data source with an invalid expression referring to it.

### Known Issues

* Importing a module containing workflows makes all running workflow instances incompatible. (Ticket 234084)
    * Fixed in [10.21.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.21/#fix-workflow-instances).

## 10.18.5

**Release date: April 8, 2025**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.18.5" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.18.5 from the Marketplace" %}}

### Improvements

* We mitigated CVE-2024-38374 by upgrading the CycloneDX Gradle plugin to 1.10.0. The CVE does not pose risk for Mendix customers. (Ticket 243005)
* We improved the performance of published OData services that use OData version 4 and publish associations as a link. The runtime now only queries the database for associations that the client specifies in `$expand`. (Ticket 239978)
* We improved the performance of workflow versioning conflict analysis for workflows with many nested outcome-based activities. (Ticket 242615)
* We improved deployment speed for non-progressive web applications.
* We made the administration of running application nodes more stable. We also improved the logging in this area. This makes running tasks from the queue more reliable.
* We now throw a consistency error if your custom *index.html* does not contain the correct elements for the chosen client (in either React or Dojo).

### Fixes

* We fixed the case where the Offline Database was not properly cleaned after sign out operation. (Ticket 237830)
* We fixed an issue that controls in pop-up dialogs sometimes did not resize correctly when the dialog was resized. (Ticket 238211)
* We decreased the chance for database transaction deadlocks when updating the **LastActive** attribute for System.Session instances. (Ticket 240094)
* We changed when we send back hash updates for object changes. This should solve the hash conflict errors when running flows in parallel with a microflow that both Read/Write the same object. (Tickets 240118, 240696, 241168)
* We fixed an issue where an error was thrown if a change to an object was done after the object had been deleted by another process. (Ticket 240247)
* We fixed an issue that was causing scrolling to be disabled on pop-up pages in Design mode. (Ticket 241293)
* We fixed the navigation profile selection. When using an iPad, it will now correctly use the tablet navigation profile if available. (Ticket 241824)
* We upgraded the Netty dependency to 4.1.118. (Ticket 242071)
* In the logic editors, we fixed an issue where multiple identical parameters were generated if a parameter or variable was used more than once by the selection to extract. (Ticket 242517)
* We fixed a Studio Pro crash which happened when logging a list of strings from a Java action. (Ticket 243124)
* We fixed <kbd>F9</kbd> view app shortcut. It is used to view the currently running app in the browser. (Ticket 243743)
* We improved the stability of Studio Pro when debugging nanoflows.

* We fixed the validation of pending tasks from a previous deployment, which failed in case there were optional microflow parameters.
* We fixed an issue that in Studio Pro on macOS the **Check all** and **Uncheck all** toolbar buttons did not work.
* We fixed an issue in the logic editors where some automatically generated variable names were accidentally translated.

* We fixed an error that occurred when using keyboard navigation in a tree control.
* We fixed an issue with error handling affecting the **Offline PWA Sign Out** action. The issue occurred when empty local directories were deleted.
* We fixed how the Mendix Runtime reports errors when a non-existing entity is used for instantiating or querying objects.

* We fixed an issue in consumed OData services where the HTTP response from downloading metadata from a URL was not cleaned up correctly.
* We fixed an issue where an unexpected exception occurred in Studio Pro when you closed the app while Studio Pro was checking it for consistency errors.

* In the logic editors, we fixed an **Oops** pop-up window that sometimes occurred when deleting a microflow or nanoflow.
* We resolved a potential crash when moving a folder into its child folder. It is now not possible to move a parent folder into any of its child folders.
* We fixed an issue where an **Oops** pop-up window was shown when extracting widgets that use an `unknown` entity type in a snippet.

* We made the connection between Studio Pro and the Catalog more robust, ensuring that network issues when downloading images from the Catalog no longer trigger an error pop-up window.
* We fixed the checkbox **Show inactive threads (wait/park)** in the **Runtime Threads** window of Studio Pro.
* We fixed an issue where an incorrect Git configuration setting caused repeated triggering of the file line ending alignment mechanism.

* We fixed an issue where startup images were not exported for PWAs using the React client.
* We fixed an issue with updating module roles in the **Module Security** dialog box that occurred after moving a document between modules.
* We fixed [CVE-2025-30280](/releasenotes/security-advisories/#30280).
* We modified how runtime reports errors when a non-existing entity is used when instantiating or querying objects.

### Breaking Changes

* We removed the `PhoneUserAgentRegEx` and `TabletUserAgentRegEx` custom runtime settings, because now user agents are no longer sufficient to identify device types. We have moved device type detection to the client which can use more than just the user agent to determine a user's device.

### Known Issues

* Importing a module containing workflows makes all running workflow instances incompatible. (Ticket 234084)
    * Fixed in [10.21.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.21/#fix-workflow-instances).

## 10.18.4 {#10184}

**Release date: March 7, 2025**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.18.4" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.18.4 from the Marketplace" %}}

### Improvements

* We now use generated BOM-refs for managed dependencies in the SBOM.
* We improved the performance of published OData services that use a **Read** microflow. When the client asks to expand associations, the runtime now performs a database query per association, rather than per object. (Ticket 234607)

### Fixes

* In the logic editors, we disallow creating variable names that clash with predefined variables, e.g. '$CurrentUser'. (Ticket 225275)
* We fixed an issue where, when trying to save the changes in a message definition within **Structure**'s search field, text was not showing the selected elements. (Ticket 227040)
* We fixed an issue where Chrome incorrectly displayed a prompt to install a progressive web app (PWA) for non-PWA apps. (Ticket 230439)
* We fixed an issue with batch text translations and widgets: after translation widgets were prompted to be updated, this resulted in some translations being reset. (Ticket 233401)
* We fixed an issue where retrieving an external entity with a non-sortable key attribute  resulted in an error. (Ticket 236093)
* We fixed an issue in the task validation at startup, which marked pending tasks with microflow arguments as incompatible. (Tickets 237616, 238191)
* We fixed an issue where structure mode wenr blank after making changes, or showed an **Oops** pop-up window mentioning *no undo context*. (Ticket 239410)
* We fixed an issue in external entities that have an unlimited string as part of their key. Studio Pro supports this as long as you set a maximum length on the attribute. Upgrading an app to version 10.12.11 or above caused the runtime to not be able to start because it detected a change in the length of the database column. Now the app starts without changing the length of the database column. (Ticket 239892)
* We fixed an issue where Studio Pro crashed when working with the clipboard. (Ticket 240122)
* We have fixed an issue that caused the bottom bar to disappear when a user was using  nanoflow-based homepages with clear history. (Ticket 240586)
* We fixed an issue in the microflow editor where a Maia recommendation was not placed correctly.
* We fixed the following issues affecting [tab attributes](/refguide/tab-container/#attribute):
    * We fixed an issue where configuring the default tab attribute with a page parameter resulted in a deployment error. The selector of this attribute no longer allows selecting a page variable directly. Now, the attribute must be accessed via a data view. 
    * We fixed an issue where the default tab attribute was not being properly validated, and thus lead to incorrect behavior during deployment or at runtime. These scenarios are now correctly checked, and if applicable result in a consistency error. 
    * We fixed an issue where a number for the default tab attribute larger than the number of tabs resulted in an error when rendering the tab container. 
* We fixed an issue where closing the beta version of the Mapping editor showed an error.
* We fixed an issue where an **Oops** pop-up window was shown while setting *None* for a text template parameter.
* We fixed the issue with the pull operation when setting up the PMP configuration.
* We fixed an issue where attempting to convert nanoflow or microflow in the System module resulted in an error. This option is now disabled for the System module.
* We fixed an issue where certain JavaScript actions that were meant for both web and native platforms failed to bundle when using the React client.

### Known Issues

* Importing a module containing workflows makes all running workflow instances incompatible. (Ticket 234084)
    * Fixed in [10.21.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.21/#fix-workflow-instances).

## 10.18.3 {#10183}

**Release date: February 10, 2025**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.18.3" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.18.3 from the Marketplace" %}}

### Improvements

* We added logging for object or attribute found in XML or JSON payload but not mapped in the **Import mapping** document. (Ticket 213729)
* We added more support for SOAP arrays in **Import mapping** documents. Previously, only array objects with `item` as a name were supported. Now, any name is allowed for array objects. (Ticket 23729)
* In the logic editors, we added validation for a return variable name in the **End Event Properties** dialog box to ensure no invalid name can be specified.
* We added support in the External Database Connector for SQL queries with column names that contain spaces and special characters.

### Fixes

* We removed the consistency error when an association data source had steps traversing from a local to an external entity. (Ticket 203958)
* We added a setting to enable Windows Authentication for a private Git server. (Ticket 234161)
* We fixed an issue in the **Call REST** action where using a file document as the request body resulted in an HTTP request without a `Content-Length` header. (Tickets 237320, 237839, 239208)

### Known Issues

* Importing a module containing workflows makes all running workflow instances incompatible. (Ticket 234084)
    * Fixed in [10.21.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.21/#fix-workflow-instances).

## 10.18.2 {#10182}

**Release date: February 4, 2025**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.18.2" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.18.2 from the Marketplace" %}}

### Improvements

* We added a progress pop-up window when renaming, including or excluding a document/module in the App Explorer.
* We made the **Commit** dialog box faster and more responsive, which makes it smoother to use.

### Fixes

* We fixed a Windows-specific issue where temporary files created for images upload were not cleaned up. (Ticket 181323)
* We introduced a consistency error when the data source was an entity path with steps traversing from a local to an external entity. (Ticket 203958)
* We improved the memory usage of the Dojo client when running an app for an extended period of time by fixing several memory leaks that occurred when opening thousands of pages. (Ticket 232228)
* We fixed an **Oops** pop-up window that appeared when opening the **View on Your device** dialog box while running an app with navigation profiles of the same kind. (Ticket 233598)
* We fixed an issue where apps using the Dojo client broke due to browser extensions injecting scripts into the page. (Ticket 236663)
* We fixed an error in XPath constraint processing for the web client, that caused a *System.ArgumentException: QueryConstraint not found* exception in Studio Pro. (Ticket 236719)
* In the logic editors, we fixed the displayed output variable name for the **Import with a mapping** action. (Tickets 237120, 237336, 238026, 238771, 238994)
* We fixed an issue where list view item actions were not working correctly in the native client. (Tickets 232033, 237875, 238176)
* We fixed an issue where the creation of an index failed when one of its attributes was not available on the offline database. (Ticket 239701)
* We received reports of multiple tasks being scheduled for the same scheduled event. To handle this situation gracefully, we now clean up the superfluous tasks on startup. Additionally we introduced extra logging to help diagnosing these issues.
* We fixed an issue where deployment failed when an entity had one system association (**owner** or **changedBy**) already in the database and a second one was added later.
* We fixed an issue where an incorrect homepage was briefly displayed before the one configured by a nanoflow action finished loading.
* In the logic editors, we fixed extracting microflows to correctly create parameters when variables were used in loops.
* In the logic editors, we fixed a bug where we translated variable names which caused error messages to be shown.

### Breaking Changes

* <a id="revert-listening"></a> We reverted the fix for listening between widgets to continue after hiding the selecting widget, such as data grid 2, with conditional visibility. The issue will be addressed in a future release. (Ticket 206642)

### Known Issues

* Importing a module containing workflows makes all running workflow instances incompatible. (Ticket 234084)
    * Fixed in [10.21.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.21/#fix-workflow-instances).

## 10.18.1 {#10181}

**Release date: January 10, 2025**
{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.18.1" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.18.1 from the Marketplace" %}}

### Improvements

* We improved the **Move document** dialog box:
    * We removed the context menu from the dialog box.
    * We added an option to create a new module or folder in dialog box. 
    * We removed the **Show** option.
* We made improvements to the **Changes** pane:
    * Users can now resize columns to display the complete file path. Additionally, users can hover over the path to see the full file path in a tooltip.
    * We updated the button labels in the **Changes** pane, and certain dialogs to use **local** and **server** instead of **mine** and **theirs** for selecting the source when resolving file conflicts.
* We made Studio Pro use the legacy Expression editor by default on Windows; the modernized version can be activated via  **Preferences**.
* We improved the way Studio Pro opens dialog boxes, which should reduce the instances of issues Studio Pro freezing because blocking dialog boxes are not visible. Also, this fixes some issues with pop-ups and menus appearing in the wrong location.
* When installing Studio Pro, the ARM version of the Java Development Kit is installed on computers with an ARM CPU.

### Fixes

* <a id="fix-outbound-rest-request"></a>We fixed a [known issue](#ki-outbound-rest-request) in the serialization of the request body of two things: Call REST actions that use a custom request template, and Consumed REST operations that use a fixed string body. They now use UTF-8 encoding instead of ISO-8859-1. (Ticket 235194)
* We fixed an issue where filtering over system associations *owner* and*'changedBy* in a data grid 2 column failed to render. (Tickets 231167, 233168)
* We fixed an issue where items were incorrectly rendered as disabled in the native client in some cases. (Ticket 232033)
* We fixed an issue with conversion where variables on a page were presented in a different order. This issue caused certain [widget event actions](/refguide/on-click-event/#actions) to change when upgrading to Studio Pro10.4 or above. Specifically the arguments of [Call Microflow](/refguide/on-click-event/#microflow-arguments) and [Call Nanoflow](/refguide/on-click-event/#nanoflow) referring to a selection were changed if the widget was nested in another widget exposing the same entity. Note that this change does not correct previously converted apps which may now have an unintended argument configuration for Event Actions. (Ticket 233988) 
* We fixed a bug in the text box and text area widgets where the caret sometimes jumped to the end of the text during typing when the **While user is entering data** [on change behavior](/refguide/text-area/#while-user-is-entering-data) option was used. This occurred when a neighboring widget used the same attribute in an expression, for example, for Conditional Visibility. (Ticket 234672)
* We fixed an issue where using the S3 storage service resulted in a warning like *If you are using Java 9+, you will need to include javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api as a dependency.*. (Ticket 235163, 235904)
* We fixed an error where apps got stuck when their internet connections were unstable.
* We fixed a bug where disposed tool windows were still considered active in the UI, causing Studio Pro to crash when the active editor changed.
* We changed the expression editor on macOS to not use smart-quotes.
* We fixed an error that appeared when selecting a Team Server App in the **Branch Line Manager**.
* We fixed an issue with XPath collection parameters. An XPath collection parameter with a single element now has proper type conversion done like other parameters. This issue affected the workflow engine startup in cases where there was only a single workflow defined in the app.
* We fixed an issue in the error details reported by published OData services. For errors containing more than one error detail, such as when a client inserted an object with multiple required attributes missing from the request body, the order in which these details were produced was inconsistent. This inconsistency meant that changing the runtime version altered the order.
* We fixed an issue where an end-user used nanoflow-based homepages and the back behavior did not work correctly.
* We fixed an issue that was causing the pluggable widget previews to display incorrectly in **Structure mode**.
* We fixed an issue where if the application failed to reload it did not restart.
* We fixed an issue with the **Edit** and **Delete** buttons in the **Jar Dependency Exclusion** dialog. These buttons caused an error if the list was empty.
* We fixed an issue where using the offline web profile caused errors when sessions were being cleaned up.
* We fixed an issue where migrating a Java 21 application reset the Java version to 11.
* We fixed an issue when creating a new app from blank templates resulted in changed files and possible oops crash due to git client not being accessible.

### Known Issues

* Importing a module containing workflows makes all running workflow instances incompatible. (Ticket 234084)
    * Fixed in [10.21.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.21/#fix-workflow-instances).

## 10.18.0 {#10180}

**Release date: December 18, 2024**

{{% button color="info" href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/10.18.0" text="Go to Marketplace" title="Download version 10.18.0 from the Marketplace" %}}

### New Features

#### Version Control: Size Pre-Check of the MPR File

We introduced a new step during a commit process that checks for a large MPR file. We want users to be informed about large MPR files as can it become problematic for git.

#### Version Control and Storage Format

With Studio Pro 10.18, we are releasing a public beta of [MPRv2 format](/refguide/version-control/#mpr-format), a new storage format for Mendix apps that ensures a good performance over time.

Version Control systems, like Git, store changes in your files with each commit. An app modeled in Mendix is traditionally stored in a single *.mpr* file, which is essentially a database that contains data for all documents, such as microflows, workflows, pages. Git is not well-equipped to determine and store the differences in this case, which leads to rapid repository growth. This in turn can lead to longer download times when cloning your app.

With MPRv2 the key difference is that all documents, such as microflows, will no longer be stored as part of the *.mpr* file but as separate files in the *mprcontents* directory. The *.mpr* file will function as an index file pointing to all the different files on disk. This means that when you change one document, for example, a page, that only a small file representing that page will change on disk. This allows Git to calculate an efficient delta, which results in a more appropriate repository growth compared to MPRv1.

Upgrading to the new format is optional and can be done per branch.

#### Security Overview (Beta)

We are introducing a new beta feature that provides an overview of your app’s security. You can now get an overview of access rules across your application, making it easier to review and ensure the correct security setup for user roles in each module. Access this overview from the **App** menu by selecting **Show Security Overview**. Currently, this feature supports entity access rules, and we will extend support to page, microflow, and nanoflow access rules soon. For more information, see [Security Overview](/refguide/security-overview/).

#### Other New Features

* We introduced [UI Recommender](/refguide/ui-recommender/) to the page editor, which allows users to easily add new widgets to a page without having to lose context of what they are currently working on. 
* The React client is now generally available. For more information, see [Mendix React Client](/refguide/mendix-client/react/). For more guidance on upgrading widgets, see [Widget Conversion Limitations](/refguide/mendix-client/widget-conversion-limitations/).
* We added [Maia Learn](/refguide/maia-learn/), a way for new developers to get quickly up to speed with Mendix core concepts. It is available through the toggle button in Maia Chat.
* We added a welcome page to Studio Pro that opens on every new version installed. It contains links to the release notes, Mendix platform blog, links within Studio Pro to Maia Learn and Maia Chat. 
* We added the ability to view file changes and resolve conflicts directly from the **Changes** pane in Studio Pro. You can now open the file comparison tool to review modified files or navigate to the folder containing any changed file listed in the **Changes** pane. To resolve conflicts, simply choose to keep your local version or accept the incoming server version. This update streamlines the management of both project and disk files. For more information, see the [Status](/refguide/using-version-control-in-studio-pro/#status) section in *Using Version Control in Studio Pro*.
* We added a new option: [Generate Bill of Materials](/refguide/app-menu/#generate-bill-of-materials) that is now available under **App** > **Tools**.
* We added a new setting called [Editor Tabs Closing Policy](/refguide/preferences-dialog/#closing-policy) that allows to limit the amount of concurrent working area tabs. 
* We added the ability to export the translatable text in your app and re-import it using `mx.exe`. Use `mx.exe translate --help` for an overview of the command line options. For more information, see the [mx translate Command](/refguide/mx-command-line-tool/app/#translate) section in *App Commands*.
* We added consistency checks for custom *index.html* files to inform developers in case they accidentally hard-code templated values.
* Data Importer now allows Excel and CSV files to be used as a source for creation of Import Mapping, which further can be used to leverage all the benefits of Import Mapping.
* We introduced Native Template 11 for native apps in 10.18 and above. This upgrade disables support JavaScriptCore (JSC) in favor of Hermes. For details on migrating and resolving breaking changes, see the [Native Template 11 release notes](/releasenotes/mobile/nt-11-rn/#jsc-hermes).

### Improvements

* [Maia Domain Model Generator](/refguide/domain-model-generator/), a way to generate domain models using natural language, is now enabled by default while it was previously hidden behind a **New Features** setting. It is now also supported in existing domain models.
* We added various UI improvements to Consumed REST service for better user experience.
* We added progress indicator while sending a request in Consumed REST service document.
* We added progress indicator while validating JSON body in Consumed REST service document.
* It is now possible to rename, delete, and duplicate a request in the Consumed REST Service editor by clicking the button with three dots next to the request name.
* We switched to Hermes as the default JavaScript engine for all native mobile applications. This change enhances performance, reduces memory usage, and speeds up start times for mobile apps, leading to a smoother user experience.
* We added a logger which logs to a console in JSON format.
* We added the `WebSocketEndpointConfiguration` interface to the Mendix Runtime API. An implementation of this interface can be passed to the [`Core.addWebSocketEndpoint`](https://apidocs.rnd.mendix.com/10/runtime/com/mendix/core/Core.html#addWebSocketEndpoint(java.lang.String,javax.websocket.Endpoint)) method to configure subprotocols and modify the handshake for web sockets. Modifying the handshake can be used to update response headers.
* We implemented a new method, [`getDatabaseSettingAsString()`](https://apidocs.rnd.mendix.com/10/runtime/com/mendix/core/conf/Configuration.html#getDatabaseSettingAsString()) in the Mendix Runtime API to access database settings.
* We now use the `ApplicationRootUrl` setting to determine if application cookies should be marked as `Secure`. Previously, we were only checking `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Scheme` headers.
* We improved the naming of *mine/theirs* in the **Changes** pane when merging or rebasing to more clearly describe whether changes are coming in from the server or have been made locally. For more information, see [Combining Changes and Conflict Resolution](/refguide/merge-algorithm/).
* We improved accessibility for the **Close** button in delete confirmation dialog boxes. It can now be reached with tab, and has a better `aria-label`.
* We increased the coverage of localization of the Studio Pro user interface by 25%.
* We improved the quality of Japanese translations based on feedback from users.
* Data Importer now supports new-line characters in Excel headers while importing.

### Fixes

* <a id="fix-line-endings"></a>We fixed a [known issue](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.0/#css-ki) where Studio Pro theme files (such as *theme-cache/theme.compiled.css.map*) showed up as changed. This situation was caused by incorrect generation of line endings in automatically generated content. For existing apps that have mixed line endings possibly on different branches, the file can show up as changed again. To correct the issue for your app on the opened branch, commit the change.
* In the logic editors, we fixed an issue when extracting a submicroflow with annotations that were not in the same looped activity as other objects. (Ticket 207767)
* We fixed a deployment issue with reference (set) selection pages where they sometimes lost selection functionality after other documents had been changed. (Ticket 221185)
* We fixed an issue in the logic editors where using the middle mouse button to pan the canvas did not work when the mouse was over connection points, error handler icons, resize handles, and Bézier curve handles. (Ticket 224031)
* In the logic editors, extracting a microflow did not create parameters for variables that were created inside the new microflow. (Ticket 226919)
* In the logic editors, we fixed the displayed output variable type for retrieve actions when following a self-association. (Ticket 227953)
* In the logic editors, we fixed the generated return values when extracting submicroflows. (Ticket 229998)
* We fixed the issue where localization errors were reported while running command line tools. (Ticket 230517)
* We fixed an issue where apps could not be opened after a merge conflict was resolved. (Ticket 233793)
* We fixed an issue where cyclic snippet calls caused a crash in Studio Pro when Strict Mode was enabled.
* We fixed an issue where pasting widgets from one document template to another threw an error.
* We fixed an issue in the error check that led to a crash when a document was changed again after an earlier change introduced errors because selected elements could not be found.
* We fixed Studio Pro freezes that might happen when editing pages.
* In the **Message Definitions** editor we now warn the user to refresh when the previously configured structure no longer matched the selected entity.
* We fixed the sync issue between the Consumed REST service editor and the domain model, now Consumed REST service document does not need to be reopened to reflect changes in the domain model.
* Now the correct request is visible in the Consumed REST Service editor when you open the editor starting from a request error or warning, or when you press **Show** from a **Send REST Request** microflow activity.
* We fixed an issue in consumed OData services where using large metadata files caused an exception when finding associations (called *partners* in OData).
* In the logic editors, we no longer open property dialogs when ctrl+Enter, alt+Enter, or shift+Enter are pressed, only Enter without additional keys.
* We fixed several issues in the Offline Profile validations where an **Oops** pop-up window appeared.
* We fixed an issue in the new entity access rules editor on high DPI screens, where icons sometimes appeared blurry and content peeked through borders during scrolling.
* We fixed an issue where user tasks from excluded workflows did not get properly converted when updating a Mendix app to 10.12.
  
### Deprecations

* We no longer support Gradle versions below 8.5.
* We deprecated a few legacy setter methods from the public API: `ISession.setTimeZone` and `ISession.setUserAgent`.
* We deprecated a few classes and interfaces in our internal M2EE API library: `com.mendix.m2ee.api.AdminAction`, `com.mendix.m2ee.api.AdminException`, `com.mendix.m2ee.api.IAppContainer`, `com.mendix.m2ee.api.IMxRuntime`. We also deprecated the methods `com.mendix.m2ee.api.IMxRuntimeRequest.getContext` and `com.mendix.core.conf.Configuration.checkConfig`.
* We deprecated `com.mendix.core.actionmanagement.CoreAction` class. You can use `com.mendix.systemwideinterfaces.core.UserAction` instead.
* We deprecated `IContext context()` method in `com.mendix.systemwideinterfaces.core.UserAction`. You can use `IContext getContext()` instead.
* We deprecated the method `IMendixObjectMember<?> getMember(IContext context, String memberName)` in IMendixObject interface. You can use `IMendixObjectMember<?> getMember(String memberName)` instead.
* We deprecated `String getUnhashedValue()` method of `MendixHashString`. The method was meant for internal use only.
* We deprecated `getClonedContext` methods in `CoreActionHandler` and `InternalCoreAction`.
* We deprecated `Boolean isValid(IContext context, String identifier)` method in `com.mendix.core.objectmanagement.member.MendixEnum` and provide an alternative version that does not require `IContext` parameter.

### Known Issues

* <a id="ki-outbound-rest-request"></a>The body for outbound REST requests, sent by either a **Call REST service** or a **Send REST request** activity, is incorrectly formatted using ISO-8859-1 encoding instead of UTF-8, which is the applied encoding for Studio Pro versions up to 10.16. (Tickets 235194, 237487)
    * Fixed in [10.18.1](#fix-outbound-rest-request).
* Importing a module containing workflows makes all running workflow instances incompatible. (Ticket 234084)
    * Fixed in [10.21.0](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.21/#fix-workflow-instances).
