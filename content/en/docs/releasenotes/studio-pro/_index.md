    banner: "With the October 14 update of Windows 11, Studio Pro 9, 10, and 11 can become unusable. Studio Pro shows errors in different panels (for example design properties and toolbox) and editors (for example page, microflow, nanoflow, and rule editor).<br/>If you see the message <code>Hmmm... can't reach this page</code> with an error code of <code>ERR_CONNECTION_RESET</code>, in a tool panel or editor, your workstation is probably affected.<br/>The fix for this is to install \"Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus - KB2267602 (Version 1.439.210.0)\".<br/>See the <a href=\"https://status.mendix.com/\" target=\"_blank\">status page</a> for more information."
