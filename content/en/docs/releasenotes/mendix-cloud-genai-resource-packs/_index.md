These release notes cover changes made to the [Mendix Cloud GenAI Resource Packs](/appstore/modules/genai/mx-cloud-genai/resource-packs/).

## 2025

### September 1, 2025

#### New Features

* [Mendix GenAI Resource Packs](/appstore/modules/genai/mx-cloud-genai/resource-packs/) are now generally available. They enable seamless integration of GenAI into your Mendix ecosystem by leveraging GenAI Models and Knowledge Bases. With these packs, you can accelerate advanced use cases such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic AI.
You can access them through the [Mendix Cloud GenAI Portal](https://genai.home.mendix.com/).

#### Improvements

* We introduced a new landing page for the Mendix Cloud GenAI Portal, providing a more intuitive and streamlined experience to find and access GenAI resources.

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where uploading a file to the **Knowledge Base** in the Mendix Cloud GenAI Portal failed when creating a new collection.
