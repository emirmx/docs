#### New Features

* [Mendix GenAI Resource Packs](/appstore/modules/genai/mx-cloud-genai/resource-packs/) are now generally available. They enable seamless integration of GenAI into your Mendix ecosystem by leveraging GenAI Models and Knowledge Bases. With these packs, you can accelerate advanced use cases such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic AI.
You can access them through the [Mendix Cloud GenAI Portal](https://genai.home.mendix.com/).

* Admins can now view the **Last Used Date** for all configuration keys in the **Configuration Key Overview** page.

#### Improvements
