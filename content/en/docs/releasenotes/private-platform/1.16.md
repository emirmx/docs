These release notes cover changes made to the [Private Mendix Platform](/private-mendix-platform/) in version 1.16.

## 1.16.0

### Release date: November 29, 2024

Version 1.16.0 of Private Mendix Platform introduces a number of new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

#### New Features

##### Configurable Deploy Pipeline

You can now configure the Deploy pipeline to take into consideration the type of changes. In the administrator **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Deployment** section, there is a new check box which allows you to bypass the deployment steps and instead simply restart the app in case of changes to the app environment (such as the app constants or the number of replicas).

##### Configurable Login Banners

You can now configure a banner that users will see before, during, or after the login page of your app, for example, to display any information about privacy or security that you want to communicate to your users. Administrators can enable or disable this setting in the **Settings** > **Preferences** > **General** > **Branding** > **Access Banner** section of the administrator menu.

##### Additional Languages for Private Mendix Platform

Private Mendix Platform is now available in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

#### Improvements

##### AWS ECR Supported as OCI registry

Private Mendix Platform now supports Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) as the OCI registry for build input. For more information, see [Configuring CI/CD on Kubernetes](/private-mendix-platform/configure-k8s/).

##### Engineering Improvements

###### Admin Can Force a Logout for All Users

Admins can now log out any individual user, or all logged in users at the same time. The options are available in the **Manage** > **Users** > **User Management** > **Actions** and **Users** sections of the administrator menu.
