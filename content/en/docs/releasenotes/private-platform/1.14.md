These release notes cover changes made to the [Private Mendix Platform](/private-mendix-platform/) in version 1.14.

## 1.14.0

### Release date: September 30, 2024

Version 1.14.0 of Private Mendix Platform introduces a number of bug fixes and improvements.

#### New Features

##### Automatic SBOM Generation for the Built-in Pipeline

For customers using the built-in Kubernetes-based build pipeline provided by the Platform, an SBOM with metadata is now automatically generated when building your app deployment artifact. You can download the SBOM for governance purposes.

#### Improvements

##### Authenticated Downloading of Deployment Artifacts

After your application has been built into an MDA (deployment package), you can now secure the downloading of the MDA package for deployment purposes with authentication. This avoids allowing anonymous access to the storage bucket of deployment packages, providing a more secure process.

##### Webhook Improvements

###### Installer No Longer Requires Redis for Webhooks

Private Mendix Platform has a built-in webhooks capability. In previous releases, this capability required provisioning a Redis database to install the webhooks server component, Svix. With this change, Redis is no longer a hard requirement, and the installer will treat it as an optional configuration. 

This means new platform deployments can forego Redis for webhooks, though it remains recommended for using our webhooks server (Svix) with high-traffic platforms that have a high volume and frequency of webhook calls configured. For more information, see [Private Mendix Platform Quick Start Guide: Prerequisites](/private-mendix-platform/quickstart/#prerequisites).
