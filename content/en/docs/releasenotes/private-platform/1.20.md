### Release date: March 27, 2025

Version 1.20.0 of Private Mendix Platform introduces a number of new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

#### New Features

##### AWS Secret Manager Supported during Installation

Instead of manually configuring the database and storage plans during installation, you can now use the information stored in AWS Secret Manager. For more information, see [Private Mendix Platform Quick Start Guide](/private-mendix-platform/quickstart/).

#### Improvements

##### Build Timeout Configuration in the Build Pipeline

We have moved the **Build Timeout** configuration from the **Build Image Settings** page to the Build pipeline configuration for easier access.

##### OIDC Module Supported for Mapping Custom IdP Claims

Private Mendix Platform now provides the same Just-in-Time provisioning functionality for mapping custom IdP claims as the [SAML module](/appstore/modules/saml/).

##### UX Improvements

The **MDA/OCI source URL** field on the **Deployment Steps** page is now marked as optional.
