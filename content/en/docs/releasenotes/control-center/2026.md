## January 2026

### January 22, 2026

#### New Features

* We have revamped the Marketplace section of Control Center, and have added a few new features and improvements meant to help you more efficiently manage and govern component approvals:

    * You can now add the company-approved (<text class="badge badge-pill badge-company-approved" style="margin-left:0px"> {{% icon name="checkmark-shield-filled" color="green" %}}COMPANY APPROVED</text>) badge to private Marketplace components as well.
    * We have updated page names in an effort to better convey their purpose: 
    
        * **Public Marketplace** is now **Company-Approved**. For details, refer to [Company-Approved](/control-center/company-approved/).
        * **Private Marketplace** is now **Submitted Requests**. For details, refer to [Submitted Requests](/control-center/submitted-requests/).

    * The **Submitted Requests** page is now split up into three tabs instead of two. The newly added tab is **Approval Settings**, and it includes the approval options that were previously displayed at the top of the **Pending Approvals** tab.

### January 5, 2026

#### New Features

* We have introduced **Private Connectivity**, a zero-trust security infrastructure which helps you manage connections between your Mendix Cloud apps and internal resources, bypassing the public internet. It allows you to create secure networks through which your apps can safely access internal databases and services hosted on-premises or in cloud environments, without exposing them publicly.     
  Refer to [Private Connectivity](/control-center/private-connectivity/) for background details and architecture, then read through [Configuring and Using Private Connectivity](/control-center/configure-private-connectivity/) to learn how to create and manage your own private networks.
