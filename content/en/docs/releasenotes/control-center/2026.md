#### New Features

* We have introduced **Private Connectivity**, a zero-trust security infrastructure which helps you manage connections between your Mendix Cloud apps and internal resources, bypassing the public internet. It allows you to create secure networks through which your apps can safely access internal databases and services hosted on-premises or in cloud environments, without exposing them publicly.     
  Refer to [Private Connectivity](/control-center/private-connectivity/) for background details and architecture, then read through [Configuring and Using Private Connectivity](/control-center/configure-private-connectivity/) to learn how to create and manage your own private networks.
