##### New features

The [Compass](https://compass.home.mendix.com/) tool is made available to teams who want to plan and streamline the implementation of their first Mendix app. With the Compass tool, you can define your own vision of low-code and the apps that you want to build with Mendix, and then simplify their implementation by following a number of predefined best-practice milestones and action points. For more information about the tool, see [Preparing to launch your First Mendix App with Compass](/developerportal/compass/).
