### Improvements

#### Logging Is Configurable in Workspace Settings

The level of logs written to log files and visible in the client is configurable in Workspace Settings. You can configure the following:

* Log level: Info, Warn, Error, Debug.
* Log retention policy: Maximum log folder size (in MB) and maximum number of stored days.

The workspace log level is overridden to *Debug* for a station configured in developer mode.

#### Editing Devices in the Side Panel

When editing a device, device settings are edited in a side panel. It makes device configure easier as all setting parameters are in one view and other device configurations can be viewed while editing.

### Known Bugs and Limitations

* Windows Workstation Client hangs when Smartcard reader detection is enabled and the *Smart Cards for Windows Service* is disabled.
* The Workstation Client window is not visible when opened on a secondary screen and the secondary screen is no longer available.

#### App Upgrade

To upgrade your app from a previous version, perform the following steps:

1. Remove the existing StationConnector module.
2. Remove the existing StationInterface module.
3. Import the StationConnector 2.1.0 .mpk from the Mendix Marketplace.
4. Refactor your app replacing calls to previous actions with new actions:

    1. Replace the connection action call with a **SubscribeToMessages** call:

        1. Configure the callback nanoflow.
        2. Set **Subscribe once** to **false**.
        3. Configure the **Application context** object. It will be conveyed to the nanoflow when receiving messages.
        4. Save the **SubscriptionId** in your object.
        5. Provide the following parameters for the **Message call back** nanoflow:

            * Application context object (the same as for subscribing)
            * Device
            * Message (String)

    2. Add a call to **SubscribeToError** to manage error logic:

        1. Save the **ErrorSubscriptionId** in your object.
        2. Provide the following parameters for the **Error call back nanoflow**:

            * Application context object (the same as for subscribing)
            * Device
            * ErrorMessage (String)
            * ErrorCode (Integer)

    3. Replace the Disconnect call with **Unsubscribe** (passing **SubscriptionId** and **ErrorSubscriptionId**) or **Unsubscribe by Context** (passing the **Application context** object).
    4. Replace Send Message by the new **Send Message**; to implement the same behavior as before, set **Wait for response** to **false**. Alternatively, rework your app logic to leverage the new **Wait for response** option.

5. In Workstation Management, perform the following steps:

    1. Add your app URL to the list of apps configured for your station.
    2. By the added app, click the menu icon, and then click **Generate Private Key**.
    3. Copy the generated key.
    4. Click **Use this private key**.

6. Refresh the Workstation Client.
7. Run the app.
8. Add the private key to your App Data using the **StationConnector_Security** page.
9. Refresh the page.

#### Known Bugs and Limitations

* The Workstation Connector currently allows user roles to read and write the **ManagementPrivateKey** entity, leading to the key being exposed through the XAS API.
