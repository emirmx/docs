## December 2023

### December 28, 2023

#### New Features

* We now support [regional fallback](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#regional-fallback) in Mendix Cloud. With regional fallback, the database and file storage of your application are replicated to another Mendix Cloud region. If the primary region of your application goes down due to an outage, we will switch over to the fallback region. Your app will then be available to process requests from the fallback region. Without regional fallback, you will have to wait for the primary region to become available again. Regional fallback is part of our Premium Plus cloud resource packs.
    * Regional fallback is available in all Mendix Cloud regions except Tokyo. We will offer regional fallback in Tokyo in Q1 of 2024.

### December 21, 2023

#### Improvements

* If a user tries to upload or transport an MDA file that exceeds the maximum size of 1 GB, they will now see an error message warning them that their MDA file is too big.

### December 14, 2023

#### Improvements

* The application disk usage and CPU usage graphs on the Metrics page now have y-axes that scale dynamically, with the minimum set to 0 and the maximum set to the maximum data point included in the request.
* Under the Deploy API v4, we increased the maximum limit value for `/apps/{appId}/environments` from 20 to 100. 100 is also the new default limit value. For more information, see [Deploy API – Version 4](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api-4/).

## November 2023

### November 22, 2023

#### Improvements

* We improved the layout and display of the Metrics page. Metrics can now be filtered via drop-down menus that set the time period (day, week, month, or quarter) and the group (application, database, or all) for the graphs. We also updated the visual style of the graphs. For more information, see [Metrics](/developerportal/operate/metrics/).
* We improved the layout and functionality of the Logs page. The log archives now display file size for app and access logs, and they include an option to filter logs by date. For more information, see [Logs](/developerportal/operate/logs/).
* The Logs page now has an activity log, which reports data on who has viewed or downloaded the logs. The activity log records access by team members as well as members of Mendix Support, who may view or download your app's logs in connection with any support tickets you have open. 

### November 16, 2023

#### Improvements

* We added support for sending application runtime logs and metrics to [New Relic](/developerportal/operate/newrelic-metrics/).
* We deprecated the `SPLUNK_LOGS_REDACTION` and `DATADOG_LOGS_REDACTION` environment variables.
* We introduced the `LOGS_REDACTION` variable, which is compatible with [Splunk](/developerportal/operate/splunk-metrics/), [Datadog](/developerportal/operate/datadog-metrics/), and [New Relic](/developerportal/operate/newrelic-metrics/).

## October 2023

### October 26, 2023

#### Improvements

* We added support for an `Origin-Trials` HTTP header in the Developer Portal. To use this header, the customer must first deploy (or redeploy) their app sometime after 26 October, 12:00 PM. If the customer has deployed since this date, then they can simply set the header and restart their app to use the header. For more information, see [HTTP Headers](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#http-headers).

### October 25, 2023

#### Improvements

* We added support for gp3 storage instances for databases; this provides higher baseline storage performance compared to gp2. IOPS and throughput performance will be upgraded according to the table below.

    * From October 25 onwards, when a customer creates a new DB instance, it is provisioned with a gp3 storage instance if it has a storage size of at least 20 GiB (as specified in the table below). This also occurs when the customer's database is recreated.
    | Storage Size           | Storage Instance Type | Baseline Storage Performance      | Provisioned IOPS Range | Provisioned Throughput Range |
    | ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
    | Less than 20 GiB       | gp2                   | 100 IOPS (3000 Burst) / 125 MiB/s | 100 - 1197 IOPS        | 128-250 MiB/s                |
    | Between 20 and 400 GiB | gp3                   | 3000 IOPS / 125 MiB/s             | N/A                    | N/A                          |
    | 400 GiB and higher     | gp3                   | 12000 IOPS / 500 MiB/s            | 12000 - 64000 IOPS     | 500 - 4000 MiB/s             |

    * Existing databases eligible for this upgrade will be migrated later. More details will follow.

    * For more information, see [Database IOPS Burst Balance](/developerportal/operate/metrics/#Trends-dbmxdatabaseburstbalance) in the *Metrics* documentation.

### October 12, 2023

#### Portal Enhancements

* We moved the **Running Now** interface from the **Metrics** page to the [Environment Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/) page. This interface now displays as a dialog box, accessed by clicking the **Show Running Now** action button when the environment is running.

#### Fixes

* We fixed some inconsistencies that appeared in the UI during MDA package uploads. 

## September 2023

### September 19, 2023

#### Improvements

* We introduced a timeout limit for Free Apps where idle connections are actively running a transaction. This change enhances system efficiency by automatically releasing resources from idle, ongoing, transactions to optimize overall performance.

### September 18, 2023

#### Improvements

* To improve the security of [Team Server](/developerportal/repository/team-server/) for apps versioned with SVN, we have dropped support for TLS v1.0 and TLS v1.1 when connecting to the SVN Team Server.

### September 14, 2023 

#### Improvements

* In the Build and Deploy APIs, we have added a link to download packages from the Developer Portal. This is controlled by a parameter on the following API calls:
    * [Retrieve Package](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/build-api/#retrieve-package) in the Build API
    * [Retrieve Environment Package](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api/#retrieve-environment-package) in the Deploy API
* We have deprecated the [Download Package](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/build-api/#download-package) call in the Build API.

## April 2023

### April 20, 2023

#### Improvements

* We have updated the [Splunk](/developerportal/operate/splunk-metrics/) integration to send app metadata to the Splunk Cloud Platform, together with the ability to add custom tags.

## March 2023

* The `DT_TENANT` environment variable is now required for the Dynatrace integration.

* We have enabled DNSSEC to authenticate DNS lookups for `cname.mendix.net`.
    * This means that custom domains for applications in the Mendix Cloud will validate using DNSSEC, provided it is also enabled for the custom domain.

### February 21, 2023

#### Improvements

* We now return HTTP headers for the SHA1 Fingerprint and Serial number of an authenticated Client Certificate. For more information, see [Mendix Cloud HTTP Request Headers](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-request-headers/).
