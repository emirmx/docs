description: "Release notes for deployment to Mendix Cloud"

These release notes cover changes to deployment to [Mendix Cloud](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/).

Mendix Cloud deployments are also dependent on the latest version of the [Mendix Cloud Foundry Buildpack](https://github.com/mendix/cf-mendix-buildpack). The [Mendix Cloud Foundry Buildpack release notes](https://github.com/mendix/cf-mendix-buildpack/releases) are published separately, as other deployment targets are also dependent on the buildpack.

There are separate release notes for other deployment targets; for more information, see the [Deployment](/releasenotes/developer-portal/deployment/) release notes.
