## January 2026

### January 18, 2026

#### New Features

* We have added support for centralized certificate management. Through the updated [Custom Domains](/developerportal/deploy/environments/#custom-domains) tab on the **Cloud Settings** page, Technical Contacts can now centrally manage custom domain certificates rather than only at the application level. They can also check whether a certificate is managed locally at the app level or centrally.

### January 16, 2026

#### New Features

* We have added metrics support to Splunk integration


### January 11, 2026

#### Improvements

* During [deployment package creation](/developerportal/deploy/environments/#create-package-wizard), **App highest tag** and **Branch highest tag** on the **Options** tab have been renamed to **App latest tag** and **Branch latest tag** respectively to ensure consistency with other Mendix applications.
* A new **Ineligible** status has been added to the [Plan Change Requests statuses](/developerportal/deploy/change-plan/#plan-change-status).
* The warning banner about APM tools for Kubernetes applications has been removed from the custom environment variable configuration dialog, as APM tools are now fully supported.

#### Bug Fixes

* We fixed an issue on the [Permissions tab](/developerportal/deploy/environments/#permissions-tab) where the environment selection dropdown did not correctly display the selected environment name. (Ticket 264653)
* We fixed the banner shown when free app deployment is blocked so that it now links to the correct **Control Center** page.

### January 5, 2026

#### New Features

* We have added a new feature in the **Connectivity** tab of the **Environment Details** page that enables Technical Contacts to securely [connect Mendix applications to external resources](/developerportal/deploy/connecting-to-external-resource/) through [Mendix Cloud Private Connectivity](/control-center/private-connectivity/).
    * From the [Connections](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#connections) section of the **Connectivity** tab, Technical Contacts can now request new private connections, track the status of their pending connection requests, connect to external resources, and delete existing connections.
