## December 2018

### December 1, 2018

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue that caused deployments for some users to hang. (Tickets, 76691,76700)
* We fixed a security issue that allowed app team members without deploy access to see the debugger password. (Ticket 76172)
* We fixed a security issue that allowed app team members without deploy access to see application constants. (Ticket 76171)
* We addressed and fixed an issue that prevented some users from being able to deploy to their environments. (Tickets 77060, 77122)

## November 2018

### November 14, 2018

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue in which [custom error pages](/howto/front-end/custom-error-page/) did not work for online applications in Mendix Cloud v4.

### November 1, 2018

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue that caused an error while creating a backup in Mendix Cloud v4. (Tickets 70086, 70090, 75936, 75996)

## October 2018

### October 30, 2018

#### Improvements

* Cloud v3 PostgreSQL backups are now created with `pg_dump` version 1.13. This version has been shipped with PostgreSQL since March 2018 (PostgreSQL 10.3, 9.6.8, 9.5.12, 9.4.17, and 9.3.22). The side-effect is that it is not possible to restore these PostgreSQL backups using a `pg_restore` version below 1.13. The error that you will receive is `pg_restore: [archiver] unsupported version (1.13) in file header`. To fix this issue, upgrade your PostgreSQL client software to one that includes newer versions of `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`.

### October 17, 2018

#### Improvements

* It is now possible to pause and resume downloading backups for Mendix Cloud v4 applications.
* We have overhauled the scaling user interface to make it more intuitive. (Ticket 67557)
* We addressed an issue that caused live logging to freeze from time to time. The fix has been confirmed on all mainstream browsers except for Internet Explorer, which we still are investigating. (Ticket 66418)

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue which caused subdomain validation errors for sandbox environments. (Ticket 56574)

## August 2018

### August 21, 2018

#### Fixes

* We have fixed a bug that was causing some Mendix Cloud v4 users to unsubscribe from alerting lists after changing environment privilege settings.
* We have addressed an issue that caused some Mendix Cloud v4 users to not to be able to see their archived logs from previous day.

### August 13, 2018

#### Fixes

* We improved the feedback messages in the case of a startup failure.
* The status page link in alert emails now redirects you to the corresponding alerts page in the Developer Portal.
* We solved an issue that caused blank error messages during backup creation.

#### Improvements

* A new API call for accessing the logs of Mendix Cloud v4 applications is now available. Detailed information can be found in the [Deploy API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api/).
* It is now possible to add custom environment variables via the Developer Portal to set up application metrics with Datadog and Telegraph.
* All the log levels in the Developer Portal (as in, INFO, ERROR, TRACE, DEBUG, WARNING, CRITICAL) are now also available in Datadog.
* The Postgres database size can also be observed in Datadog after enabling it in the Developer Portal.
* The **Environments** breadcrumb in **Deploy** > **Environments** > environment is now a link that redirects you back to the **Environments** page.

### August 9, 2018

#### Improvements

* Alerts are now sent when a Mendix Cloud v3 app or database runs out of system memory.

### August 8, 2018

#### Improvements

Over the last few months, we have made several improvements to our alerting stack of Mendix Cloud v4 applications to improve the timeliness of alerts. As a consequence, we are reducing the runtime heartbeat timeout from 15 minutes to 3 minutes. We are doing this to ensure that you do not accidentally miss any alerts. We will be monitoring your applications for false positives.

In some cases, you may still experience false positives for the runtime heartbeat alert. If that happens, you can resolve the problem by doing a transport and then a restart of the app.

## July 2018

### July 23, 2018

#### Improvements

* We added alerts on database connections and on internal alerting problems.
* We added Telegraf as a sidecar for monitoring.

#### Fixes

* We fixed problems with the uploading, downloading, and restoring of backups with very large databases in Cloud v4.
* We fixed the problem wherein 404, 403, and 503 responses to a REST call translated to an HTML error page.

### July 17, 2018

#### Improvements

* We improved the deployment speed for the Asia region. The feature is not enabled by default, so you need to request it if necessary.
* We implemented tags on environments for metrics in Datadog. It is now possible to add custom tags to metrics that will serve as selection criteria for grouping environments. Environment tags can be created, retrieved, and deleted using APIs. Detailed information can be found in the [Deploy API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api/).
* We changed the yearly overview of trends to quarterly in the Developer Portal for v4 applications.
* It is now possible for an Operations Manager to reorder environments.
* Custom offline pages are now immediately active after the transport of a new deployment package.

#### Fixes

* You now get a warning if you try to restore a backup into a small environment. (Ticket 63367)
* Creating a backup via REST API no longer returns error message 500 when it succeeds. (Ticket 65762)

### July 2, 2018

#### Improvements

* We improved the stability of the alerting stack.

## June 2018

### June 26, 2018

#### Fixes

* We fixed the bug that allowed users to start an application during a restore.

### June 15, 2018

#### Improvements

* We added support for client certificate validation in the **Access Restriction Profile** for Mendix Cloud v4 deployments.

#### Fixes

* We fixed the incorrect message that was shown during the scaling of a non-deployed environment. (Ticket 64799)
* Retrieving an environment package via REST API is no longer broken. (Tickets 65348, 65370)
* We reintroduced copy privileges for operations.

### June 11, 2018

#### Improvements

* We added alerts for when an application runs out of memory or otherwise unexpectedly crashes. This is only applicable to Mendix Cloud v4 deployments.

### June 8, 2018

#### Improvements

* We have introduced scaling via API for Mendix Cloud v4. It is now possible to scale Mendix Cloud v4 applications via the Deploy API. For instructions, see the [Deploy API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api/).
* We have aggregated the health icons for the acceptance and test environments in the **Nodes** dashboard and **Company Admin** screen.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/releasenotes/deployment/mendix-cloud/CPHealthIcon.png"   width="300"  class="no-border" >}}

* The health icon will display the health status of the environment that is in the worst condition. This is to prepare for an upcoming release that will support more than three environments per application.

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue in our alerting infrastructure that prevented some Mendix Cloud v4 users from receiving alerts when their apps ran out of memory.
* We fixed the problem that caused the Mendix Cloud v4 **Metrics** legend to remain on the screen even if the user navigated to a different page.
* We fixed the health icon statuses of the environments so that they reflect the environment health with minimum delay.

## May 2018

### May 22, 2018

#### Fixes

* We fixed the bug in Mendix Cloud v4 that prevented users from using nested custom domains. Now you can have one domain (for example, `app.example.com`) and one on `microservice.app.example.com`.

### May 5, 2018

#### Improvements

* It is now possible to add a comment as an optional parameter to the backup while generating one via REST API.
* It is now possible to see the Mendix Runtime version in response to a "Retrieve Environment Package" API call.

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue that prevented our Mendix Cloud v4 users from uploading and restoring big backups (larger than ~30 GB) to their environments. It has been tested with the archives (~90 GBs) on Mendix Cloud v4.
* We addressed and fixed an issue that caused Mendix Cloud v4 users in the Asia Pacific time zone to receive the wrong timestamps when they downloaded daily logs.

## April 2018

### April 9, 2018

#### Improvements

* As of today, Mendix Cloud v4 users will be able to create and restore backups of their environments via REST API. Detailed information can be found in the [Deploy API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api/) documentation.
* The results of **Retrieve Environments** and **Retrieve Environment** REST API calls will now also include the model version and Mendix version information of the applications for which the call is being made.

## March 2018

### March 21, 2018

#### Improvements

* Applications in Mendix Cloud v3 that were running for more than 248 days started to use 100% CPU due to an unknown bug in either the Mendix Runtime, the JVM, or a combination thereof. A very small number of applications have been impacted by this, as most applications are updated much more often, and every deployment restarts an application. However, this problem has been causing performance issues for both the affected applications and our infrastructure. As a workaround, we will now automatically restart apps that have been running non-stop for 247 days between 01:00 and 07:00 local time of the cloud region. If this happens to an application, you will see a message in the application log.

### March 20, 2018

#### Improvements

* We enabled ICMP (ping) packets for our Mendix Cloud v4 load balancers. Now you can use tools like ping, traceroute, and mtr to debug connectivity issues from your location to Mendix Cloud v4 applications. Note that packets will not reach the actual application but only the load balancers. You can expect latency in the low single-digit milliseconds between the load balancers and applications.

### March 16, 2018

#### Fixes

* Users of Mendix Cloud v4 applications will now see a notification if their environment fails to clean properly.
* The health status of newly-created Mendix Cloud v4 applications used to be reflected with a red cross. This has been fixed.

#### Improvements

* We have improved database storage alerts for Mendix Cloud v4 applications. If you subscribed to your applications' alerts, you will receive a warning alert when you have less than 25% disk space on your applications' databases and a critical alert when disk space is below 10%. You need to re-deploy your application to activate this alert.
* Live logging for Mendix Cloud v4 applications is here! You can now view logs neatly and in real-time.

### March 13, 2018

#### Improvements

* In the Mendix Cloud, we have renewed the SSL/TLS certificates for *.mendixcloud.com*, *.mxapps.io*, and *.mendix.com*.

### March 1, 2018

#### Fixes

* Switching between environments in the **Metrics** menu of Mendix Cloud v3 apps is now fixed.
* We fixed the synchronization problem that prevented Mendix Cloud v3 users from seeing their latest nightly backups.

## February 2018

### February 27, 2018

#### Fixes

* When uploading a backup in Mendix Cloud v3, double-clicking the **Restore** button was causing the UI to break. This is now fixed.

### February 23, 2018

#### Improvements

* In Mendix Cloud v4, the native memory usage of applications was very high. This led to crashes and automatic restarts, especially on containers with 1 GB of memory. We activated an advanced memory limiting setting for glibc (`MALLOC_ARENA_MAX`), which will prevent this behavior. The fix will automatically be applied to all apps that are transported and restarted as of today.

### February 22, 2018

#### Improvements

* We implemented a popular feedback item – the platform will now remember your selected environment while switching between screens.
* It is now possible to see the database details such as **DB Plan Space**, **Plan Cores**, and **Plan Memory** of a Mendix Cloud v4 application.
* Scaling Mendix 7 apps is now simplified and faster.

#### Fixes

* Backup creation was reported as a backup restore action in the activity feed, which is now fixed.
* We addressed and fixed an issue where a backup activity item was added each time the backups page was viewed.
* The environment details list was loading slowly for some of our users, which is now fixed.

### February 19, 2018

#### Improvements

* In Mendix Cloud v4, we have enabled logging slow database queries. This is the custom runtime setting `LogMinDurationQuery`, and it is useful for finding performance bottlenecks in your application. The value is set to a default of 10,000 ms, which was also the value on Mendix Cloud v3. You can customize this setting by using the **Runtime** tab on your environment details screen under **Environments**. To start using this feature on a Mendix Cloud environment, transport your deployment package and restart your app.

## January 2018

### January 25, 2018

#### Fixes

* The target cloud of a Free App is now shown correctly in the **Environments** section.
* Happy new year! We addressed an issue where backup downloads were logged as restored backups in the activity log.
* If you had a **Backups** section of your apps open in multiple tabs, you saw multiple activity log entries for each action taken. That's fixed now.
* The restart and stop/start activities are now distinctly defined in the **Activity** section.
* Branches of an application are sorted alphabetically, but **Main Line** is now always on top.
* The broken styling of the **View Current Log** button for a Free App has been fixed.

#### Improvements

* The **Alerts** section in Mendix Cloud v4 apps will now include health check details, just like for Mendix Cloud v3 apps.
