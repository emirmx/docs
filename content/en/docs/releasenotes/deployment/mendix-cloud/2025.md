## December 2025

### December 23, 2025

#### New Features

* We have added logging support to Dynatrace integration.

### December 14, 2025

#### Improvements

* We enhanced the security infrastructure with stronger access controls for internal data objects

### December 06, 2025

#### Improvements

* We have upgraded Mendix Dock to support contract expiry banners. Mendix Cloud can now provide timely information when contracts are approaching their expiry dates.

## November 2025

### November 23, 2025

#### New Features

* We have introduced [Version Pinning](/developerportal/deploy/version-pinning/) for deployment components on Kubernetes to ensure consistency across customer environments and avoid unexpected deployment behavior. You can use this feature by promoting an application from one environment to a higher environment.

* It is now possible to deploy Mendix applications with [Zero-Downtime](/developerportal/deploy/zero-downtime/) without any service interruption in certain cases. You can enable this by selecting the **Deploy without downtime** option in the **Options Tab** of the [Deploy Wizard](/developerportal/deploy/environments/#deploy-wizard). This feature applies to changes that do not rebuild or replace your app package.

### November 9, 2025

#### New Features

* We have added a new feature on the **Cloud Settings** page, called [IP Restriction Profiles](/developerportal/deploy/access-restrictions/#ip-restriction-profiles), to block IP addresses at the root level of your application URL. Once configured, profiles can be applied in the [IP Access Restriction](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#ip-access-restrictions) section on the **Networks** tab.

#### Bug Fixes

* We have fixed an issue where custom domain routes were not removed entirely, even when they were deleted from the application.

## October 2025
  
### October 29, 2025

#### New Features

* Apps deployed to Kubernetes now support New Relic, enabling them to be migrated from Cloud Foundry to Kubernetes.

* For Kubernetes deployments using New Relic, the `instance_index` tag is no longer provided within metadata. Use the `pod_name` tag instead.

### October 19, 2025

#### New Features

* We have added a new feature in the **Environment Details** page for flexible environments. Users can now use non-Latin characters in the display name of their environment. The display name of an environment can be changed independent of the environment's subdomain.

* We have added support for email internationalization. The emails sent by the Developer Portal will now be translated to the language set in user's profile.

#### Bug Fixes

* We have fixed an issue where apps were getting stuck in the "starting" state instead of failing gracefully due to missing package metadata.

### October 12, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

* We have fixed an issue that prevented environment deployment activities from being displayed on the [Activity tab](/developerportal/deploy/environments/#activity-tab).

### October 5, 2025

#### New Features

* We have added support for IP blocklisting in the **Access Restriction Profile** for apps deployed on Kubernetes, allowing you to block incoming requests from specific IPs that match the configured profile.

#### Bug Fixes

* We have fixed an issue where duplicate paths were added in **Path Based Access Restriction** and caused deployment failures for apps on Kubernetes. The fix prevents new duplicates, but existing ones must be manually removed.

### October 1, 2025

#### Announcement – Deprecation of HTTPS SSL/TLS Weak Ciphers from February 1, 2026

To improve the security of HTTPS connections to applications in Mendix Cloud v4, we are deprecating and stopping support for the following block ciphers that are considered weak:

* `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
* `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`

**What this means for your Mendix applications**

Clients that only support DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) ciphers with RSA key exchange will no longer be able to connect to your Mendix application.

**What we continue to support**

We will also introduce new, recommended SSL/TLS ciphers. These additions will finalize the list of ciphers that will continue to be supported for HTTPS connections after February 1, 2026:

**TLSv1.3**

* `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
* `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
* `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`

**TLSv1.2**

* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
* `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`
* `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
* `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
* `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`
* `TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`

## September 2025

### September 21, 2025

#### Improvements

* We have renamed the **Request Overview** tab on the **Environments** page to **Change Requests**.

### September 9, 2025

#### New Features

* We have added support for sending logs to Splunk for apps deployed on Kubernetes. This enables apps using Splunk to be migrated from Cloud Foundry to Kubernetes.

#### Improvements

* For Kubernetes deployments, the `SPLUNK_LOGS_REDACTION` environment variable is not available. Use the `LOGS_REDACTION` variable instead.

## August 2025

### August 17, 2025

#### New Features

You can now change your plan from the [Plan Details](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#plan-details) section in the **Environment Details** window. To do that, click **Change Plan** next to the plan name.

## July 2025

### July 27, 2025

#### New Features

* We have enhanced the reliability of the health icon. As part of this update, we introduced a new **Alerts** label to indicate critical or warning-level [alerts](/developerportal/operate/monitoring-application-health/) from the application logs. The health icon now exclusively reflects the environment's running status.

#### Bug Fixes

* We fixed an issue where users were unable to view backups of their Sandbox apps. (Ticket 252022)
* We improved the **Export to Excel** option in the [Model Options](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#model-options) tab. The exported file now uses a comma delimiter instead of a semicolon. (Feedback #1460)
* We refined the sorting behavior on the **Permissions** page. Items are now sorted by name and grouped by type (Role-based / Non-role-based) (Feedback #1458)

### July 13, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

* We have implemented strict validation on the [Upload Package API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/deploy-api-2/#upload-package). The request parameter keys now require exact name matching, especially for the file key.
* We fixed an issue where the **Resource Mismatch** label was displayed incorrectly. This label will now appear only when the UI scale settings differ from the backend cloud resource settings.

## June 2025

### June 12, 2025

#### New Features

* We have added a new beta feature in the [environment UI](/developerportal/deploy/environments/). This feature allows Technical Contacts to [change app's environment plan](/developerportal/deploy/change-plan/) to a higher-resource plan.
    * Additionally, a new tab ([Change Requests](/developerportal/deploy/environments/#change-requests)) has been introduced where Technical Contacts can view and manage plan change requests and track the status of their pending requests awaiting a Mendix Admin review from the [Control Center](/control-center/approval-requests/).

## May 2025

### May 25, 2025

#### New Features

* We have added a new warning message about required overhead (database disk space) before starting a backup restore.
  
#### Improvements

* We have updated the validation rules for creating custom domain names. Instead of 53 characters limit, it is now set to 63 characters limit in compliance with DNS standards.
* Old UI is deprecated and will be removed on June 1. Users will automatically be switched to the new UI if not already done before.

#### Bug Fixes

* We fixed a bug where user got an error while opening the permissions tab for production environment (Ticket 241675).

#### Temporary Deprecations

* Basic plan offering is being temporarily paused.

## April 2025

### April 17, 2025

#### Improvements

* We have added new environment variables which allow you to control the buffer size and buffer memory for the Fluentbit agent for Splunk and New Relic.

## February 2025

### February 20, 2025

#### Improvements

* We have updated the custom JMX metrics prefix from `jmx` to `mx`. This change ensures that these metrics are not indexed as `custom metrics` in Datadog.

### February 2, 2025

#### New Features

* We have added a number of new features which are all available as part of the [new UI](/developerportal/deploy/environments/). These are:

    * Redesigned the **Environment Details** page to improve functionality and enhance the user experience.
    * Added staging support for apps in the deploy wizard.
    * Added the ability to compare and edit model options across environments.
    * Redesigned the **Environments** page for Free Apps.

#### Improvements

* Based on user feedback, the [new UI](/developerportal/deploy/environments/) now also contains UX improvements to the **Environments Overview** page for paid apps.
