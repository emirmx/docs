These release notes cover changes to the functionality and other features of the [Mendix Pipelines](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-pipelines/).

To see the current status of the Mendix Pipelines, see [Mendix Status](https://status.mendix.com/). Here you can also see planned maintenance and past incidents.

## 2025

### June 27, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

* We fixed a bug where users could not trigger the on commit trigger Mendix Pipeline (Ticket 245653)

### February 27, 2025

#### Improvements

* We have added a validation mechanism for the Mendix Pipeline designs, which prevents users from deleting a design if any Mendix Pipelines using that design are currently running. For more information, see [Mendix Pipelines: Editing a Mendix Pipeline Design](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-pipelines/#edit-pipeline). 
* You can now access the **Details** page of a Mendix Pipeline at any point, also while the Mendix Pipeline is running. For more information, see [Mendix Pipelines: Run Results](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-pipelines/#run-results).

## 2024

### November 14, 2024

#### New Features

* We added a new **Variables** tab that allows you to create user-defined Mendix Pipeline variables. For more information, see [The Variables Tab](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-pipelines/#variable-tab) in the *Mendix Pipelines* documentation.
* We added a new Mendix Pipeline step: [Unit Testing](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-pipelines/#unit-testing). This step executes the Unit Testing module in a running environment to perform a regression testing and marks the Mendix Pipeline as failed if any tests fail, providing the failure count and details.

### September 19, 2024

#### New Features

* We released an API that lets you start a new Mendix Pipeline run for a saved and activated Mendix Pipeline design and retrieve the status of a Mendix Pipeline run. For more information, see [Mendix Pipelines API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/pipelines-api/).
* We added a new Mendix Pipeline step: [Best Practice Recommender](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-pipelines/#recommender) Check. This step lets you evaluate results of the Maia Best Practice Recommender within your Mendix Pipeline.

### September 3, 2024

#### Improvements

* Deployment packages generated via Mendix Pipelines now generate a Software Bill of Material (SBOM) under the hood; this is visible in Software Composition for Studio Pro LTS and MTS versions 9.24.26 and above, 10.6.12 and above, and 10.12.3 and above.


### August 22, 2024

#### Fixes

* We fixed a bug that had been causing an incorrect Mendix Pipeline run status to display for the first few seconds on manually triggered Mendix Pipelines.

#### Improvements

* In the **Pipelines** page's **Runs** tab, we changed a column name from **Last Run** to **Run** because this more accurately reflects what the column shows: it indicates when a Mendix Pipeline run occurred.


### August 15, 2024

#### Improvements

* We added a Pipeline ID column to the **Designs** tab of the **Pipelines** page.

### July 4, 2024

#### New Features

* We added two new Mendix Pipeline steps:
    * You can use the Start Environment step to start a selected environment.
    * You can use the Promote Package step to move a deployment package from a specified source environment to a specified target environment.
* It is now possible to trigger Mendix Pipelines manually. To use this new trigger type in your Mendix Pipeline, select **Manual** as the **Trigger** in the Start Pipeline step of your Mendix Pipeline design.
* We will be launching a mini survey for Mendix Pipelines soon, asking you some questions about what you like and dislike.

#### Improvements

* Mendix Pipelines names are no longer editable while a Mendix Pipeline is active. If you want to edit a Mendix Pipeline name, deactivate the Mendix Pipeline first.
* We implemented deep links for all three tabs on the Mendix Pipelines page. This facilitates easy sharing of record-specific details on the **Runs**, **Designs**, and **Settings** tabs; you can simply copy and paste the URL.

### May 9, 2024

#### Improvements

* We added a Feedback Widget to the Mendix Pipelines pages so that customers can directly provide feedback, enhancement requests, and other ideas.
* We improved the performance of the **Runs** page's search and filtering.
* We added a column selector to the table on the **Runs** page, so it is now possible to customize which columns appear in the table. We also added a new column: Pipeline ID.

### April 4, 2024

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue that was causing Mendix Pipelines to fail at the Checkout step for selected Mendix Pipeline runs. (Ticket 211117)
* We fixed an issue preventing user settings from saving for select users.
* We fixed an issue where the branches were not being fetched for the Checkout step when designing a Mendix Pipeline. We also fixed an issue where the Checkout step was not dynamically changing upon the change of the trigger.

#### Improvements

* We made a variety of user experience improvements, including improving the styling and implementing a Mendix Pipeline name character limit of 40 characters.

### February 29, 2024

#### New Features

* We launched a new feature: Mendix Pipelines. Mendix Pipelines lets you build and deploy software in an automated way. You can design Mendix Pipelines with a set of configurable, low-code steps. Activated Mendix Pipelines run automatically according to your design. This new Mendix Pipelines feature is intended to make it quick and easy for teams to automate their CI/CD process. For more information, see [Mendix Pipelines](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-pipelines/).
    * The Mendix Pipelines feature is in [public beta](/releasenotes/release-status/). It is currently available for unlimited use with all licensed Mendix Cloud and apps. Limitations may be put on its use in the future.
