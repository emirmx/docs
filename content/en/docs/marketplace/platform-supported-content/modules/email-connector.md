3. Select the **Templates** tab.
4. Click **Add New Template** or edit an existing one using the **Action**.

{{% alert color="info" %}} The [Mx Model Reflection](/appstore/modules/model-reflection/) must be installed and properly configured in your app prior to creating placeholder tokens and before exporting/importing email templates containing placeholder tokens.{{% /alert %}}

### Creating an Email Message from a Template

Use the **CreateEmailFromTemplate** Java action to generate a draft email message that can be previewed and customized. Once finalized, send it using the **Send email** action. The input parameters are as follows:

* **DataObject** – Entity object from which placeholder tokens are extracted. To retrieve data from multiple objects, create a [non-persistable entity](/refguide/persistability/#non-persistable).
* **EmailTemplate** – Email template used to construct and send an **EmailMessage** object.
* **Queued** – When enabled (**true**), the email message is stored in the **EmailMessage** entity with a **Queued** status. This configuration enables later transmission via [scheduled events](/refguide/scheduled-events/). 

You can leverage the **SE_SendQueuedEmails** microflow to set up the necessary scheduled events. You can also create a [task queue](/refguide/task-queue/) and run the microflow in that task queue to minimize system resource usage. With a task queue, you can set the number of threads, node or cluster-wide scope, time intervals, and other parameters.

Review the demonstration microflow **Sample_ACT_CreateEmailFromTemplateAndThenSend** as a reference. This microflow demonstrates how to implement the **CreateEmailFromTemplate** Java action while managing attachments for the **EmailMessage**, incorporating both existing **EmailTemplate** attachments and supplementary files.

### Sending an Email with a Template

Use the **SendEmailWithTemplate** Java action to send an email from a template. The input parameters are as follows:

* **Data Object** – Entity object from which placeholder tokens will be extracted. To retrieve data from multiple objects, create a [non-persistable](/refguide/persistability/#non-persistable) entity.
* **EmailAccount** – Email account with the necessary send email configuration details.
* **EmailTemplate** – Email template used to construct and send an **EmailMessage** object.
* **Queued** – When enabled (**true**), the email message is stored in the **EmailMessage** entity with a **Queued** status. This configuration enables later transmission via [scheduled events](/refguide/scheduled-events/). 

You can leverage the **SE_SendQueuedEmails** microflow to set up the necessary scheduled events. You can also create a [task queue](/refguide/task-queue/) and run the microflow in that task queue to minimize system resource usage. With a task queue, you can set the number of threads, node or cluster-wide scope, time intervals, and other parameters.

Review the demonstration microflow **Sample_ACT_SendEmailWithTemplate** as a reference. For dynamic configuration of **To**, **CC**, or **BCC** fields, update the EmailTemplate object with the required attribute values and provide this modified EmailTemplate object as input to the Java action.

### Export Email Template

You can export an email template using the Email Connector to streamline the process of template recreation across various environments including development, acceptance, and production. Follow the steps below:

1. Choose the email template you want to export.
2. Select **Export** from the **Pop-up Menu**. 

An XML file will be generated with a filename that combines the template name and current datetime, and will be saved directly to your default downloads folder. The following image illustrates the downloaded XML file after completing the email template export.

### Import Email Template

An exported email template can be imported into the current deployment environment or a different one. To import, follow these steps:

1. Click **Import Template**.
2. Select the template file (*.xml*) you want to import.
3. Click **Import Template**.

## Troubleshooting

### Sending or Receiving Email

If you have issues sending or receiving emails:

1. Check the **Error logs** in **Account Settings**.
2. Review the logs in Studio Pro. 

If an email does not appear in your app and there is nothing in the logs, the problem is not with the connector.

### Gmail Accounts {#gmail-accounts}

Gmail no longer supports basic authentication (usernames and password). However, you may still be able to set up an account in the Email Connector by doing the following:

1. Read [Less secure apps & your Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255) and turn off the **Less secure app access** setting in your Google account.
2. Set up an app password to sign in to the Email Connector. For more information, see [Sign in with app passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833).

### Adding OAuth 2.0 Configuration to an App with Basic Authentication

If you already have an email account configured using basic authentication in your app, and you want to use OAuth 2.0 authentication without removing that email account, do the following:

1. On the overview page, click **Configure OAuth** and add a new configuration. For more information, see [OAuth Provider Configuration Details](#oauth-config-details).
2. For the desired email account, set the **isOAuthUsed** attribute of the **EmailAccount** entity to **True**.
3. Associate the email account with your newly created OAuth provider.
4. Navigate to the overview page, click **Manage Accounts**, and select the account.
5. Go to the **Server Settings** tab in **Account Settings** and select **Re-authenticate Access**.

### Deprecation of Basic authentication in Microsoft Exchange Online

As of October 1, 2022, Microsoft has deprecated Basic Authentication, and it is no longer supported in Exchange Online, promoting Modern Authentication (OAuth 2.0) for enhanced security. From that date, Microsoft started disabling Basic Authentication for the following protocols:
 
* Outlook
* EWS
* RPS
* POP
* IMAP
* EAS

### Deploying to On-Premises Cloud Environments

When deploying [on premises](/developerportal/deploy/on-premises-design/) on [Microsoft Windows](/developerportal/deploy/deploy-mendix-on-microsoft-windows/), you need to add the following rule to the *web.config* file:

```
<rule name="mxecoh">
   <match url="^(mxecoh/)(.*)" />
   <action type="Rewrite" url="http://localhost:8080/{R:1}{R:2}" />
</rule>
```

For more information, see the [Reverse Proxy Inbound Rules](/developerportal/deploy/deploy-mendix-on-microsoft-windows/#reverse-proxy-rules) section of *Microsoft Windows*.

### Configuring Local Email Clients

Configuring local clients, such as [Papercut](https://github.com/ChangemakerStudios/Papercut-SMTP), is supported. If you are using a tool like Papercut, do the following:

1. Follow the steps for [adding an email account](#adding-email-account).
2. Continue with manual configuration in the wizard (automatic configuration does not work for local clients).
3. Select the **Send emails** checkbox.
4. Select **SMTP** for the **Protocol**, and enter *localhost* for the **Server host**. Enter the **Server port** number (for example, *25*).
  
Both email and password are not required.

### Adding Attachments

#### Normal Attachment

To add attachments to the email message, do the following:

1. Create an **Attachment** entity. The **Attachment** entity extends the **FileDocument** entity by making it usable in all the places where the **FileDocument** entity is required.

   {{% alert color="info" %}}If you have a custom entity, extend it with the **Attachment** entity instead of **FileDocument**, or use the community commons **DuplicateFileDocument** function to create an **Attachment** from your custom entity.{{% /alert %}}

2. Set the **Attachment_EmailMessage** association.

#### Inline Attachment

To add inline attachments to an email message, use the Rich text editor to insert images directly into the email body. Alternatively, you can insert inline attachments using a microflow by following these steps:

1. Create an EmailMessage with the `Content` property set as seen below:

    ```
    'before inline image<br><img src="cid:mxcid:test.png" width="530" height="110"><br>after inline image'
    ```

2. Specify the image's tag source using the **cid:mxcid** prefix before the source file to have the image added as inline image.
3. Create the attachment with the Position attribute set to **ENUM_AttachmentPosition.Inline**.
4. Associate the attachment with EmailMessage. You can then send the email using the **SUB_SendEmail** microflow.

### Page Styling

If the **Email Connector** page styling is affected as you select and view email messages, it is likely due to errors in the email message CSS. 

To resolve the errors, turn on **Sanitize email to prevent XSS attacks** in [Account Settings](#other-account-settings).

### Importing Emails with Long Attachment Names

{{% alert color="info" %}} This issue is resolved in version 5.3.0 of the Email Connector. {{% /alert %}}

Some email clients (for example, Gmail) break down the name of attached files if it is longer than a specific value, and add the file name in the **Content Type** for an attachment. This can cause an error while fetching or importing emails with long attachment names. For example: *"ERROR - Email_Connector: Attribute 'Email_Connector.Attachment.attachmentContentType' has a maximum length of 200, tried setting a value of length xxx."*. 

## Known Issues

### Widgets

If you already have the [included widgets](#included-widgets) in your app, and they are not up to date, you may get a "Some widgets cannot be read" error when trying to run locally.

### Consistency Error

You may get a consistency error when importing the Email Connector module in Mendix 10.1 or above that states *"No argument has been selected for parameter "Token" and no default is available"*. This can be resolved by double-clicking the error, which takes you to the snippet **SNIP_EmailTemplate_NewEdit**. Double-click the **Edit [default]** button, then in the **Events** field under **Page settings**, click **Edit**. Once the **Page Settings** dialog box opens, click **OK**, as shown in the image below. The error should resolve.

### Duplicate Mx Model Reflection Objects in Email Template

{{% alert color="info" %}} It is recommended to try this microflow in a non-production environment and check if is working as expected after the cleanup. After the successful validations, run it in the production environment.{{% /alert %}}

The Email Template export/import functionality introduced in EC v5.8.0 had a bug, which was subsequently fixed in v5.9.0. If you exported and imported Email templates using EC v5.8.0, you may see duplicate records in the placeholder entity drop-down, as shown below.

{{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/platform-supported-content/modules/email-connector/duplicate-mx-reflection-objs.png" class="no-border" width="700" >}}

To clean up these duplicate Mx Reflection records, a microflow is delivered as part of EC v5.9.2. As the cleanup microflow (**DEL_DuplicateMxReflectionObjects**) deletes database records from certain tables, it is strongly advised to complete a full DB backup before proceeding with the steps below. At a minimum, the following 3 tables must be fully backed up before starting.

1. MxObjectMember
2. MxObjectReference
3. MxObjectType

To perform the cleanup, follow these steps:

1. Call the **DEL_DuplicateMxReflectionObjects** microflow from a page using the **Call microflow** button. This should preferably be executed by an Admin user as a one-time activity.

    This microflow identifies and removes duplicate records from the backend. Upon completion, a pop-up dialog confirms the process has finished. The Console log displays the number of records removed from each respective table.

   {{< figure src="/attachments/appstore/platform-supported-content/modules/email-connector/mx-reflection-objs-cleanup-logs.png" class="no-border" width="700" >}}

2. After completing the cleanup process, remove the **Call microflow** button from the page to prevent the microflow from being triggered again.
