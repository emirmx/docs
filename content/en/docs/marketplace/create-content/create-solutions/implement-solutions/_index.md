## Introduction

This page provides information and guidance on how to set up and upgrade a solution.

## Solution Lifecycle

There are three main stages a solution goes through during its lifecycle:

* **Build** – This stage is performed by an ISV, who creates a solution and releases new versions with improvements. Mendix recommends releasing a new solution version along with a [Studio Pro LTS](/releasenotes/studio-pro/lts-mts/#lts) release.
* **Implement** – At this stage, the solution is adapted to fit a specific customer's needs. This can be done by the ISV, an implementation partner, or the customer themselves.
* **Consume** – This stage is the actual production use of the application by the customer.

## Implementation

As the **Build** stage is an iterative process, a new version is periodically released by the ISV. In the **Implement** stage, the implementer needs to incorporate the changes from this new version into the current implementation.

To be able to implement, you must set up the solution in the proper way to enable future upgrades to new versions provided by the ISV. For more information, see [Setting Up Solutions](/appstore/creating-content/sol-set-up/).

For details on the upgrade procedure for a solution that has been set up correctly, see [Upgrading Solutions](/appstore/creating-content/sol-upgrade/).
