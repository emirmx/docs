## Introduction

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) transforms business applications, empowering developers and technologists to create smarter, more dynamic solutions. This document provides the knowledge and tools needed to make your first GenAI-powered application and guides developers and business technologists in integrating GenAI into their Mendix applications.

## Key Resources to Continue Your GenAI Journey

### Getting Started with the How-Tos

* [Build a Chatbot Using the AI Bot Starter App](/appstore/modules/genai/how-to/starter-template/)
* [Build a Chatbot from Scratch Using the Blank GenAI App](/appstore/modules/genai/how-to/blank-app/)

### Starter Apps

* The [GenAI Showcase App](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/220475) demonstrates over 10 use cases for implementing GenAI.
* The [Support Assistant Starter App](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/231035) is a template that incorporates [RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)](/appstore/modules/genai/rag/), [Function Calling (ReAct Pattern)](/appstore/modules/genai/function-calling/), and knowledge base integration. For more details on this use case, see [How to Build Smarter Apps with Function Calling & Generative AI](https://www.mendix.com/blog/building-smarter-apps-with-function-calling-and-generative-ai/).

### Prompt Engineering Resources

* The [Prompt Engineering](/appstore/modules/genai/prompt-engineering/) documentation provides an introduction to the basics of prompting and useful tips.
* The [Prompt Library](https://mendixlabs.github.io/smart-apps-prompt-library/) offers a collection of prompts used in Mendix applications, as well as other examples.
* The blog post [Hey ChatGPT, Write a Blog Post About Prompt Engineering – Part 1](https://www.mendix.com/blog/part-one-hey-chatgpt-can-you-write-me-a-blog-post-about-prompt-engineering/) introduces the fundamentals of prompt engineering, including techniques and examples.
* The blog post [Hey ChatGPT, Write a Blog Post About Prompt Engineering – Part 2](https://www.mendix.com/blog/hey-chatgpt-can-you-write-me-a-blog-post-about-prompt-engineering-part-2/) explores the Tree of Thought (ToT) prompt technique, provides recommendations for getting started, and discusses how to handle hallucinations.

### Additional Resources

* Basic documentation on [GenAI Concepts](/appstore/modules/genai/get-started/) is an essential resource for anyone beginning their GenAI journey.
* The [GenAICommons](/appstore/modules/genai/genai-for-mx/commons/) module as a prerequisite for all GenAI components.
* The [ConversationalUI](/appstore/modules/genai/conversational-ui-module/conversational-ui/) module that offers UI snippets for chat, token consumption monitoring and prompt management.
* The [Mendix Cloud GenAI Resource Packs](/appstore/modules/genai/mx-cloud-genai/resource-packs/) to learn how to quickly access GenAI capabilities from a Mendix app.
* The [OpenAI](/appstore/modules/genai/openai/) provides essential information about the OpenAI connector.
* The [Amazon Bedrock](/appstore/modules/aws/amazon-bedrock/) provides key information about the AWS Bedrock connector.
* The [MCP Server Module](/appstore/modules/genai/mcp-server/) provides reusable operations to create and initialize an MCP server inside of a Mendix app to expose tools and prompts to external clients.
* The [PGVector Knowledge Base](/appstore/modules/genai/pgvector/) offers the option for a private knowledge base outside of the LLM infrastructure.
