## Introduction

In order to help developers integrate GenAI capabilities into custom applications, Mendix Cloud provides GenAI Resource Packs. These packs offer access to Large Language Models (for text generation and text embeddings) and knowledge bases, enabling seamless implementation of common GenAI patterns in a low-code environment. They simplify the process of leveraging GenAI technologies for Mendix customers and partners by abstracting complex provisioning processes and reducing configuration to just a few clicks within the platform experience. Feel free to contact [genai-resource-packs@mendix.com](mailto:genai-resource-packs@mendix.com) to learn more.

## Resources Overview

There are three different types of resources: 

* Compute – Text Generation: generates human-like text based on given inputs, essential for applications requiring natural language generation. 

* Knowledge Base: A knowledge base can be used to upload your data which then can be used by a text generation resource. 

* Compute – Embeddings Generation: converts text into vector representations. An embeddings resource is required to uploading data to your Knowledge Base.

## Getting started

1. Learn about GenAI Resource Packs and how to acquire them in the [Mendix Cloud GenAI Resource Packs](/appstore/modules/genai/mx-cloud-genai/resource-packs/) document.
2. Once you have access to GenAI resources, log in to the [Mendix Cloud GenAI portal](https://genai.home.mendix.com/) to generate access keys for your resources. This portal provides an overview of all the resources you have access to and you can also request new GenAI Resources there. For more information, see [Navigate through the Mendix Cloud GenAI Portal](https://docs.mendix.com/appstore/modules/genai/mx-cloud-genai/Navigate-MxGenAI/).
3. Use a starter app containing the [Mendix Cloud GenAI Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/239449) (for example, the [BlankGenAI starter app](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/227934)) or implement the connector in the Mendix application according to its documentation. Once you have imported access key in its configuration overview, you are connected to Mendix Cloud GenAI and can access available resources within your application.
