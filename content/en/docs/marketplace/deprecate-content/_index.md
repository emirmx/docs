## Introduction

You can deprecate components that are no longer supported or maintained, or that have better alternatives. This offers Marketplace users a clear view of which components are not recommended, as well as which components they can use instead.

Follow these steps to deprecate a component:

1. Access the **My Content** page by clicking **My Content** in the Marketplace **Personal** section.
2. In the **Actions** menu of the component you want to deprecate, click **Deprecate**.
3. In the **Deprecate Component** window that opens, fill in the following information:

    * Add a **Reason for deprecation**. This is a mandatory field.
    * Choose one or more alternative components that can be used instead of the one you are deprecating. This is optional.

4. Click **Deprecate Component**.

A badge is now displayed across the component's Marketplace page, letting users know why it was deprecated, and what alternative components are recommended by Mendix.
