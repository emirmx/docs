## Introduction

You can deprecate components that are no longer supported or maintained, or that have better alternatives. This offers Marketplace users a clear view of which components are not recommended, as well as which components they can use instead.

You can deprecate components from several places:

* The **My Components** page in the **Personal** section
* The **My Company Components** page in the **Company** section
* The component page in the Marketplace itself

The steps are the same no matter where you are:

1. Find the component you want to deprecate, and click its contextual menu.    
    On the **My Components** and **My Company Components** pages, this menu is available in the **Actions** column.
2. Click **Deprecate**.
3. In the **Deprecate Component** window that opens, fill in the following information:

    * Add a **Reason for Deprecation**. This is a mandatory field.
    * Choose one or more alternative components that can be used instead of the one you are deprecating. This is optional.

4. Click **Deprecate Component**.

A badge is now displayed across the component's Marketplace page, letting users know why it was deprecated, and what alternative components are recommended by Mendix.

## Permissions

If you are a company admin or a component developer, you can deprecate both personal components, and company components.    
However, if the component is part of a content group, you need to be a member of that group to be able to deprecate components.    
For details, refer to the [Content Group](/appstore/home-page/#content-groups) section in *Marketplace Home Page*.
