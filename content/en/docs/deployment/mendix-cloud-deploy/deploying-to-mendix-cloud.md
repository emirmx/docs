## Introduction

This page describes how to deploy an app to Mendix Cloud.

The method for deploying an app to Mendix Cloud differs depending on whether you have a licensed app or a Free App:

* For a licensed app, there are several deployment options:
    * Manual deployment – Create a deployment package via Studio Pro or the Mendix Portal, and then deploy the package to a node environment where you can run it. For details on how to do this, see [Deploying a Licensed App](#deploy-licensed-app), below. This is the simplest deployment method, especially if you are just getting started with Mendix.
    * Pipelines built with low code – If you want to automate your build and deployment process, you can use [Pipelines](/developerportal/deploy/pipelines/) in the Mendix Portal to design and activate a pipeline with a set of configurable, low-code steps. The Pipelines feature makes it quick and easy for teams to automate their CI/CD process, without requiring any third-party tools or DevOps expertise.
    * Pipelines built with APIs – If you use Jenkins, GitLab, or another CI/CD tool, you can use Mendix APIs to automate your build and deployment process. For details, see [Implement a Simple CI/CD Pipeline with Mendix APIs](/howto/integration/implement-cicd-pipeline/). This method is highly customizable but does require CI/CD tooling and DevOps expertise to set up.
* For a Free App, you deploy the app directly from Studio Pro. For details on how to do this, see [Deploying a Free App](#deploy-free-app), below.

If you are not currently a customer but would prefer to use a licensed cloud node instead of a Free App, you can find more information on the [Mendix Platform Pricing](https://www.mendix.com/pricing) page.

If you are an existing customer, you should deploy to your licensed cloud node.

## Deploying a Licensed App {#deploy-licensed-app}

 Deploying a licensed app is usually a two-step process:

* First, create a deployment package
* Second, deploy it to a node environment where you can run your app

The full process is described in detail below.

It is also possible to deploy licensed apps directly from Studio Pro. For information on how to do this, see [Studio Pro Deployment Settings](/developerportal/deploy/studio-deployment-settings/).

### Prerequisites

Before starting the process of deploying a licensed app, make sure to complete these prerequisites:

* Your app is linked to a licensed cloud node
* You have [transport rights](/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions/#transport-rights)
* [Two-factor authentication](/developerportal/deploy/two-factor-authentication/) is set up
* The deployment package for your app is not bigger than 1 GB (uncompressed)
* Your app is using a [supported Mendix version](/releasenotes/studio-pro/lts-mts/#major-version)

{{% alert color="info" %}}You can verify that your app is under the 1 GB limit by creating a deployment package, as described below, and then viewing that package's size in the package details.{{% /alert %}}

### Creating a Deployment Package for a Licensed App

There are two methods for creating a deployment package on Mendix Cloud. You can create it directly via Studio Pro, or through the Mendix Portal, using a model committed to the Team Server.

#### Creating a Deployment Package via Studio Pro {#create-deployment-package}

To create a deployment package via Studio Pro, follow these steps:

1. Open the licensed app in [Studio Pro](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/studiopro/).
2. In the top menu bar, click **App** > **Create Deployment Package**.

#### Creating a Deployment Package via the Mendix Portal {#package-from-team-server}

You can also create a deployment package through the Mendix Portal, using a model committed to the Team Server. To do this, follow these steps:

1. From [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com), go to the **Environments** page of your app.
2. On the [Deployment Packages](/developerportal/deploy/environments/#deployment-packages-tab) tab, click **Create a Package**. This launches the **Create Package** wizard.
3. On the **Select Branch** tab, select the branch on which to base the build.
4. On the **Select Revision** tab, select the branch revision on which to base the package.
5. On the **Choose a Tag** tab, specify the version tag. This includes the major, minor, and patch version numbers.
6. Click **Build this revision**.

### Deploying the App to an Environment {#deploy-the-app-to-an-environment}

The previous steps explained how to deploy a deployment package to Mendix Cloud, but the app based on the deployment package is not running yet. To deploy a deployment package to a node environment where you can run the app, follow these steps:

1. From [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com), go to the **Environments** page of your app.
2. On the [Deployment Packages](/developerportal/deploy/environments/#deployment-packages-tab) tab, choose your preferred deployment package.
3. Click **Deploy** ({{% icon name="deploy" %}}) to launch the deploy wizard.
4. On the **Select Environment** tab of the wizard, choose the environment to which you want to deploy the package.
5. On the **Configure Environment** tab, review the [constants](/refguide/constants/) and adjust them as required.
6. On the **Other Options** tab, choose whether to stage the package without deploying, and when to create the backup: either before or after deploying the new package. The app is unavailable while the backup runs.
7. On the **Deploy** tab, review the deployment settings:
    1. To see an overview of the configuration for this deployment, click **View Summary**. This summary displays the selected package, selected backup option, and any changed constants or [scheduled events](/refguide/scheduled-events/).
    2. Review this summary, then click **Deploy Now**.

The app is now deployed. You can configure the administrative account.

## Deploying a Free App {#deploy-free-app}

Deploying a Free App is a single-stage process that is completed from Studio Pro. This process is described in detail below.

### Prerequisites

Before starting the process of deploying a Free App, make sure to complete these prerequisites:

* You have created an app
* As with licensed apps, the uncompressed size of the deployment package must not exceed 1 GB

### Deploying the App

With a Free App, you can deploy your app to Mendix Cloud from Studio Pro by using one of the following methods:

* In the top bar of Studio Pro, click **Run** > **Publish**. This automatically deploys your app to a Free App environment.

* Alternatively, in the top bar of Studio Pro, click **Publish**.


## Deployment Status and Troubleshooting

The [Mendix Platform Status page](https://status.mendix.com/) shows the current status of Mendix services. If you have issues with deployment, you can check the status page to see if deployment is operational (under **Mendix Services**) or if there are other Mendix issues that may be affecting your deployment. For more information, see [Mendix Cloud Status](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-status/).
