## Introduction

You can use the **Environments** page to access information about your environments, deploy packages, manage certificates and access restrictions, and more. To access your app's **Environments** page, go to [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/) and click **Environments** on your app. You can also directly visit the **Environments** page using this link: `https://cloud.home.mendix.com/link/deploy/`*`APP_ID`*, with *`APP_ID`* replaced by your [project ID](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#general-tab).

## Tab Overview

The **Environments** page has the following tabs:

* **Overview**
* **Deployment Packages**
* **Permissions**
* **Activity**
    
### Overview Tab{#overview-tab}

In the **Overview** tab, you can view information about your environments.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-beta/overview-tab.png" alt="" >}}

You can see the following information:

* Environment name
* Studio Pro Target ({{< icon name="mendix-browser" >}}) – This is present if the environment is the designated Studio Pro target; for more information, see [Studio Pro Deployment Settings](/developerportal/deploy/studio-deployment-settings/).
* Licensed badge – This is present if the environment is licensed.
* Environment status:
    * {{< icon name="checkmark-circle-filled" color="green" >}} – The application in this environment is running.
    * {{< icon name="subtract-circle-filled" color="gray" >}} – No application has been started yet in this environment, or it has been turned off.
    * {{< icon name="alert-circle-filled" color="yellow" >}} – The application in this environment is experiencing some difficulties; check the alerts page or logs for more information.
    * {{< icon name="remove-circle-filled" color="red" >}} – The application in this environment is unstable and probably not usable anymore.
* The date and time the app was started, if it is running; this is set in the user's time zone
* Version of the deployment package
* Name of the deployment package

The most recent deployment package is shown in a banner on top of the page, along with a button to deploy it immediately.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-beta/deploy-mda.png" alt="" >}}

You can also perform the following actions:

* **More Options** ({{< icon name="three-dots-menu-horizontal" >}}):
    * **Restart** – Stops the running application and starts it again. Restarting your app is required for applying new constant values or scheduled events to the environment.
    * **Start** - Starts a stopped application.
    * **Live Log** – Shows a live log for your application. It is identical to the **View Live Log** button on the [Logs](/developerportal/operate/logs/) page.
    * **Debugger Info** – Shows the settings needed to connect the debugger in Studio Pro to your app. For more information on debugging in the cloud, see [How To Debug Microflows Remotely](/refguide/debug-microflows-remotely/).
    * **Running Now** – Monitor all actions that are currently running in your environment. For more information, see [Running Now](/developerportal/deploy/mxcloud-runningnow/).
    * **Logged in Users** – Shows all users who are logged in to your app.
    * **Stop** – Stops the application.

To view more information about each environment and the deployment package it is running, use the **Expand** ({{< icon name="chevron-down" >}}) toggle on the environment.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-beta/environment-expanded.png" alt="" >}}

In this section, you can view additional information about the environment resources and the deployed package:

* For the environment, you can view the environment ID, the deployment region, the [cloud resource pack](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#resource-pack), and the scaling configuration. To launch the **Change Scaling** wizard and [scale the environment](/developerportal/deploy/scale-environment/), click **Scale**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-beta/change-scaling.png" >}}

* For the deployment package, you can view the package name, version, and runtime. To launch the **Promote a  Package** wizard and promote the package to another environment, click **Promote**.

### Deployment Packages Tab{#deployment-packages-tab}

In the **Deployment Packages** tab, you can view information about your deployment packages.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-beta/deployment-packages-tab.png" alt="" >}}

You can perform the following actions on this tab:

* Use the **Search** field to search the deployment packages by name or version
* Click **Upload a Package** to upload a deployment package from your local device
* Click **Create a Package** to create a deployment package based on a specific branch

You can also see information and perform actions on the existing deployment packages. For each deployment package, the table contains the following details:

* Deployment status
* Deployment package name
* Deployment label, for packages that are deployed
* Version of the deployment package
* Date that the deployment package was uploaded
* Uploader account
* Expiry date of the deployment package, if one is set
    Currently deployed packages do not expire. Among any non-deployed packages, the five most recently deployed packages do not expire.
    Expiry dates apply only to packages that do not meet either of two non-expiry criteria outlined above. These packages are set to expire and be deleted within 15 days, unless they are deployed before that date.

If you click **More Options** ({{< icon name="three-dots-menu-horizontal" >}}) on a package, you can do the following:

* View details, including the package size, description, build output, and an overview of the environments that are running the package
* Delete the package

### Permissions Tab{#permissions-tab}

In the **Permissions** tab, the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/general/app-roles/#technical-contact) and other team members who have **Manage Permissions** enabled can manage various permissions to the environments for each team member. Team members who have a role with **Cloud Access** can view the permissions.

For details on managing node permissions, see [Node Permissions](/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions/).

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-beta/permissions-tab.png" alt="" >}}

### Activity Tab{#activity-tab}

In the **Activity** tab, you can view a log of deployment, backup, and permission activities performed on your environments.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-beta/activity-tab.png" alt="" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Operations performed on a customer's behalf through an authorized Mendix Support ticket are not logged in the activity log.
{{% /alert %}}

If you are the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/general/app-roles/#technical-contact), you can download a copy of the activity log by following these steps:

1. Click **Download to CSV**. (This button is only visible if you are the Technical Contact.)
2. Select the period for which you want to download log entries.
3. Click **Download**.

## Cloud Settings{#cloud-settings}

If you click **Cloud Settings** ({{< icon name="settings-slider-1" >}}) from any tab, you can adjust custom domains, access restriction profiles, and services.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-beta/manage-cloud-settings.png" alt="" >}}

## Environment Settings

If you are the [Technical Contact](/developerportal/general/app-roles/#technical-contact), you can use **Environment Settings** to choose the default target for the deployment package. If you do not select a target, the .mda packages is built and uploaded without being deployed.

{{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-beta/manage-env-settings.png" alt="" >}}

### Custom Domains

In the **Custom Domains** tab, you can manage your custom domain certificates at the application level. You can also see an overview of linked custom domains.

When you need your Mendix app to be accessible via your own URL (for example, `https://myapp.mycompany.com/`), you must provide a custom SSL/TLS certificate for your domain. This enables your Mendix app to be accessible via a secure connection. For more information, see [Custom Domains](/developerportal/deploy/custom-domains/).

### Access Restriction Profiles

In the **Access Restriction Profiles** tab, you can manage custom access restriction profiles. These profiles can combine IP range filters and client certificate verification, so that any match on either the IP range or the client certificate will grant access. You can apply access restriction profiles to path-based access restrictions in specific environments of the application.

For details on setting up access restriction profiles, see [Restrict Access for Incoming Requests](/developerportal/deploy/access-restrictions/).

### Services{#services}

In the **Services** tab, the Technical Contact can determine which custom services can be used in the app's environments.

#### Available Services

One custom service is available: **Mendix Event Broker**. This service is required to use [Mendix Business Events](/appstore/services/business-events/) on production apps.

#### Enabling Custom Services

The Technical Contact can only see services that have been licensed for their company. If the Technical Contact cannot enable the service, this means that the service has previously been licensed, but the license has expired.

Team members who have a role with **Cloud Access** can see which services are enabled or disabled.

Once a service has been enabled for an app, Technical Contacts can selectively enable it for each environment. For more information, see the [Services](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#services) section of the *Environment Details* page.

## Creating a Package {#create-package-wizard}

The **Create a Package** wizard creates deployment packages. Follow the wizard by performing the following steps:

1. In the [Deployment Packages tab](#deployment-packages-tab), click **Create a Package**. This launches the **Create a Package** wizard.
2. In the **Select Package** tab, select the branch on which to base the build.

5. Click **Build this Revision**.

## Deploying a Package {#deploy-wizard}

The Deploy or Promote wizard deploys packages to selected environments. Follow the wizard by performing the following steps:

1. Launch the wizard by choosing one of the following options:
    * Select an environment to which you want to deploy a package by clicking the **Deploy** ({{< icon name="deploy" >}}) icon on the **Overview** tab.
    * Select a package that you want to deploy by clicking the **Deploy** ({{< icon name="deploy" >}}) icon on the **Deployment Packages** tab, or by clicking **Promote** by a package name on the **Overview** tab.
2. Perform one of the following actions, depending on whether you selected the package or the environment first:
    * If you launched the wizard by selecting an environment, the first screen of the wizard is the **Select Package** tab. Use it to select a package from repository.
    * If you launched the wizard by selecting a package, the first screen of the wizard is the **Select Environment** tab. Use it to select the target environment for your package.
3. In the **Configure Environment** tab, review the new constant values, and adjust them as required.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/deployment/mendix-cloud-deploy/environments-beta/2-configure-environment.png" alt="" >}}

4. In the **Backup** tab, choose if you want to back up your app before deploying the new package. The app is unavailable while the backup runs.
5. In the **Deploy** tab, review the deployment settings:
    1. To see an overview of the configuration for this deployment, click **View Summary**. This summary displays the selected package, selected backup option, and any changed constants or scheduled events.
