## Introduction

You can use the **Environments** page to access information about your environments, deployment packages, manage certificates and access restrictions, and more.

To access your app's **Environments** page, go to [Apps](https://sprintr.home.mendix.com/) and click **Environments** on your app. You can also directly visit the **Environments** page using this link: `https://cloud.home.mendix.com/link/deploy/`*`APP_ID`*, with *`APP_ID`* replaced by your [project ID](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details/#general-tab).

## Available Tabs

The **Environments** page has the following tabs:

* **Overview**
* **Deployment Packages**
* **Permissions**
* **Activity**
* **Request Overview**
    
### Overview Tab{#overview-tab}

On the **Overview** tab, you can view the [environment information](#environment-information) and perform [actions](#environment-actions) on your environments.    

The most recent deployment package is shown in a banner at the top of the page, along with a button to deploy it.

#### Environment Information{#environment-information}

You can see the following details for each environment shown in the **Overview** tab:

* The environment's name
* The Studio Pro Target ({{< icon name="mendix-browser" >}}) – This is displayed if the environment is the designated Studio Pro target. For more information, see [Studio Pro Deployment Settings](/developerportal/deploy/studio-deployment-settings/).
* Licensed badge – This is displayed if the environment is licensed.
* The environment's status:
    * {{< icon name="checkmark-circle-filled" color="green" >}} – The application in this environment is running.
    * {{< icon name="subtract-circle-filled" color="gray" >}} – No application has been started yet in this environment, or the application has been turned off.
    * {{< icon name="alert-circle-filled" color="yellow" >}} – The application in this environment is experiencing some difficulties. Check the alerts page or logs for more information.
    * {{< icon name="remove-circle-filled" color="red" >}} – The application in this environment is unstable and probably not usable anymore.

    * Select a package that you want to deploy by clicking the **Deploy** ({{< icon name="deploy" >}}) icon on the **Deployment Packages** tab, or by clicking **Promote** by a package name on the **Overview** tab.
2. Perform one of the following actions, depending on whether you selected the package or the environment first:
    * If you launched the wizard by selecting an environment, the first screen of the wizard is the **Select Package** tab. Use it to select a package from the repository.
    * If you launched the wizard by selecting a package, the first screen of the wizard is the **Select Environment** tab. Use it to select the target environment for your package.
3. On the **Configure Environment** tab, review the new constant values, and adjust them as required.
4. In the **Other Options** tab, choose whether to stage the package without deploying, and when to create the backup: either before or after deploying the new package. The app is unavailable while the backup runs.
5. On the **Deploy** tab, review the deployment settings:

Team members who have a role with **Cloud Access** can view the permissions.

For details on managing node permissions, refer to [Node Permissions](/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions/).

### Activity Tab{#activity-tab}

### Request Overview Tab {#request-overview}

On the **Request Overview** tab, the Technical Contact can view details of all past and current [Change Plan](/developerportal/deploy/change-plan/) requests and perform certain actions based on the current request status.

For each submitted plan change request you can see the following information:

* **Request Type** – Type of change requested

    * **Scheduled** – Plan change scheduled for the next maintenance window
    * **In progress** – Plan change is being applied
    * **Completed** – Mendix Admin has approved the change, Technical Contact has scheduled and applied the changes, and the new plan has been successfully applied to the environment
    * **Rejected** – Request was denied
    * **Failed** – Plan change did not complete successfully

## Cloud Settings{#cloud-settings}

If you click **Cloud Settings** ({{< icon name="settings-slider-1" >}}) from any tab, you can adjust the custom domains, access restriction profiles, and services.

### Custom Domains

On the **Custom Domains** tab, you can manage your custom domain certificates at the application level. You can also see an overview of linked custom domains.

When you need your Mendix app to be accessible via your own URL (for example, `https://myapp.mycompany.com/`), you must provide a custom SSL/TLS certificate for your domain. This ensures a secure connection to your Mendix app. For more information, refer to [Custom Domains](/developerportal/deploy/custom-domains/).

### Access Restriction Profiles

On the **Access Restriction Profiles** tab, you can manage custom access restriction profiles. These profiles can combine IP range filters and client certificate verification, so that any match on either the IP range or the client certificate will grant access. You can apply access restriction profiles to path-based access restrictions in specific environments of the application.

For details on setting up access restriction profiles, refer to [Restrict Access for Incoming Requests](/developerportal/deploy/access-restrictions/).

### Services{#services}

On the **Services** tab, the Technical Contact can determine which custom services can be used in the app's environments.

#### Available Services

One custom service is available: **Mendix Event Broker**. This service is required to use [Mendix Business Events](/appstore/services/business-events/) on production apps.

#### Enabling Custom Services

The Technical Contact can only see services that have been licensed for their company. If the Technical Contact cannot enable the service, this means that the service has previously been licensed, but the license has expired.

Team members who have a role with **Cloud Access** can see which services are enabled or disabled.

Once a service has been enabled for an app, Technical Contacts can selectively enable it for each environment. For more information, refer to the [Services](/developerportal/deploy/environments-details-redesign/#services) section of the *Environment Details* page.
