## Introduction

The Mendix Contract Management system ensures a seamless and predictable Mendix experience by keeping you fully informed of contract statuses and maintaining data portability throughout your Mendix subscription lifecycle.

This document provides detailed information about the status of your Mendix application contracts, critical timelines, and the actions required to guarantee continuous access to your Mendix applications and services.

## Mendix Subscription Lifecycle{#mendix-subscription-lifecycle}

Your Mendix subscription is categorized into three main statuses: Active, Expiring, and Expired, based on your contract's expiry date.

| Account Status | Timeline | Impact |
|---------------|----------|--------------------|
| **Active (Green)** | Until 30 days before contract expiry | Your account is fully active, with all services available and application runtimes functioning normally. This is the optimal state for uninterrupted Mendix usage. |
| **Expiring (Orange)** | From 30 days before contract expiry until contract end date | All services continue to function normally. You receive email reminders, notifications, and banner alerts on Mendix Platform about your upcoming renewal. |
| **Expired (Red)** | From the day after contract expiry up to 60 days | Your account and applications are downgraded to **Unlicensed** mode, revoking access to Mendix Platform features such as **Control Center**. You can still deploy and manually restart apps, but they will automatically shut down after 2-4 hours and are limited to 6 concurrent users.|

## Contract Timeline and Milestones{#contract-timeline-and-milestones}
