## Introduction

Mendix on Azure offers a streamlined, fully integrated approach to deploying Mendix applications on Microsoft Azure. This solution eliminates the need for complex cloud infrastructure setup, enabling users to focus on building and delivering value faster. Through an intuitive interface, teams can easily manage their application environment and infrastructure services. Regardless of technical background, users can deploy, scale, and secure their Mendix apps efficiently on Azure.

## Benefits of Mendix on Azure

By eliminating manual setup and maintenance, Mendix on Azure enables your teams to:

* Deliver business value faster instead of managing infrastructure.
* Accelerate time-to-market and reduce deployment bottlenecks.
* Minimize cross-team dependencies and technical complexity.
* Deploy applications in under 30 minutes without specialized cloud expertise.
* Lower operational costs while maintaining security, compliance, and consistency.

## Comparing Mendix on Azure and Mendix on Kubernetes

Mendix on Azure is a deployment option that uses the same core Mendix engine as Mendix on Kubernetes, but is delivered in a standardized way within Azure environments.

While Mendix on Kubernetes gives organizations flexibility and the ability to host applications securely behind their own firewall, it demands more hands-on configuration and can take longer to realize full value when compared to deployments managed by public Mendix Cloud.​

Mendix on Azure aims to bring the best of both worlds, by offering users a preconfigured solution that can be integrated within their private networks. Deployment is simplified to such an extent that even business users without deep IT knowledge can launch production-ready environments in under 30 minutes—without incurring extra operating costs. Mendix manages the infrastructure, ongoing updates, and security hardening, eliminating technical hurdles and freeing up teams to focus on business innovation rather than infrastructure setup.​

This managed approach helps ensure reliable operations and secure best practices, while empowering citizen developers and IT professionals alike to harness the full potential of Mendix with minimal friction.
