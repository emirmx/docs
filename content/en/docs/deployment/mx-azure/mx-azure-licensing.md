## Licensing

Mendix on Azure is available for purchase from the the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/). Connecting to Azure services may also include additional cost. For more information, refer to Azure documentation.

For production environments, you also need a runtime license for your Mendix app. For more information, refer to [Licensing Apps](/developerportal/deploy/licensing-apps-outside-mxcloud/). The Operator license is applied automatically when using Mendix on Azure.
