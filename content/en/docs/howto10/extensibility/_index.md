## Introduction

One of the strengths of Mendix is that it is easy to connect your Mendix application to other systems. The [Mendix Marketplace](https://marketplace.mendix.com/) is stocked with all kinds of connectors and adapters. You are also able to extend your app by using and creating widgets.

In a related matter, one of Studio Pro's strengths is is customizability. For more information on adding your first custom extension to Studio Pro, see [Create a Menu Extension](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/csharp-extensibility-api-10/create-menu-extension/) in our API documentation.
