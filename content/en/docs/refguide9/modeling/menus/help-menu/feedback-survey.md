## Introduction

The **Help us improve** popup allows you to provide feedback on your experience with Studio Pro. This feedback is valuable for the Mendix team to understand user needs and improve the product.

The popup opens periodically for you to provide feedback. You can rate your experience on a scale of -2â€“2, with -2 being the lowest score and 2 being the highest score.

To disable the popup from opening, open the **Edit** menu and click **Preferences** > **Advanced** > **Feedback Survey** > **Show feedback survey periodically** and select **No**:

### Send Feedback

The **Send Feedback** button is disabled until a score is selected. Once a score is specified, the button is enabled, allowing you to send your feedback. You can provide justification for your score, but this is optional.
