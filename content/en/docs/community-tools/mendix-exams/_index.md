## Introduction

In the Mendix Academy there are a number of [certifications](https://academy.mendix.com/link/certifications) you can take to demonstrate your Mendix abilities.

### Booking Yourself a Seat

You can register yourself for the certification exams online by following the **Get Certified** link for each certification.

#### Free Certification 

For free certification, for example the [Rapid Developer Certification](https://academy.mendix.com/link/certifications/23/rapid), you just need to agree to the terms and you will be sent an email with instructions on how to take the exam. You will also be able to continue directly to take the exam if you want to.

You have 30 days to start the exam. When you start, you will be able to choose one of the supported languages. 

#### Paid Certification

For paid certification, for example the [Intermediate Developer Certification](https://academy.mendix.com/link/certifications/22/intermediate) you will need to arrange payment. Do the following:

1. Fill in the **Billing information**.
1. Review the **Payment Summary** and enter **Voucher** information if appropriate. The voucher details may be prefilled, depending on your organization.
1. Click **Run System Test** to ensure your system is compatible with the exam platform.
1. Confirm that you understand the terms and that your system is capable of supporting the exam.
1. Click **Register**.

You will be taken to the start page of the exam, and will also receive a confirmation email with details of the exam you have purchased.

You have 30 days to start the exam. When you start, you will be able to choose one of the supported languages.

### Booking for Other People

You can also order exam seats for other people and place bulk orders for multiple Mendix certification exam seats for your organization. In this case, contact your CSM to get the order form or for more details. You can also contact Mendix Academy directly on [academy@mendix.com](mailto:academy@mendix.com).

After receiving the order, Mendix assigns an exam admin to it. The exam admin is then responsible for overseeing the details of the order and allocating the purchased exam seats to individuals within your organization.
