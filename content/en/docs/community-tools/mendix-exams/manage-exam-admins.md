## Introduction

Your organization can place bulk orders to purchase Mendix certification exam seats. When Mendix processes the order, an exam admin is designated for each order.

As an exam admin, you can add exam admins to, or remove them from, an exam order.

## Prerequisites

All exam admins must have a Mendix account.

To manage exam admins, you must also be an exam admin. If your name is associated with an order for exam seats, then you will be made an exam admin as part of the order fulfilment process.

## Managing Exam Admins

### Adding an Exam Admin

To add an exam admin, do the following:

1. In [Mendix Academy](https://academy.mendix.com/), go to the **Access Management** page. You can see a full list of exam admins.

2. Click **Add Exam Admin** on the upper-right of the page. The **Add Exam Admin** dialog box opens.

3. In the **User** field, enter the email addresses of the exam admins who you want to add. If you enter multiple email addresses, separate them by commas.

The exam admins who are added will receive an email with a link that directs them to the [Overview](https://academy.mendix.com/link/examadmin) page for exam administration.
